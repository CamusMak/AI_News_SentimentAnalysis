"1","Matt Clifford, who is helping the prime minister set up the government’s AI taskforce, said policymakers should be prepared for threats such as cyberattacks or creation of bioweapons Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems could be powerful enough to “kill many humans” within just two years, Rishi Sunak’s tech adviser has warned. Matt Clifford, who is helping the prime minister set up the government’s AI taskforce, said policymakers should be prepared for threats such as cyberattacks or creation of bioweapons. He warned of the need mankind fails to find a way to control the expanding technology, telling TalkTV: ""You can have really very dangerous threats to humans that could kill many humans, not all humans, simply from where we’d expect models to be in two years time. “The kind of existential risk that I think the letter writers were talking about - what happens once we effectively create a new species, you know an intelligence that is greater than humans."" Mr Clifford, who chairs the government’s Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria), said that this “sounds like the plot of a movie” but was a real concern. He added: “If we try and create artificial intelligence that is more intelligent than humans and we don’t know how to control it, then that’s going to create a potential for all sorts of risks now and in the future - it’s right that it should be very high on the policymakers’ agendas.” It comes as Rishi Sunak is eager to promote the UK as a possible hub for a future global regulator, modelled on the nuclear body the International Atomic Energy Agency.  What concerned him about the present situation, he said, was that “the people who are building the most capable systems freely admit that they don’t understand exactly how they exhibit the behaviours that they do”. When asked whether this was “quite terrifying”, Mr Clifford replied: “Absolutely”.  However, Mr Clifford said that AI also had the potential to be an overwhelming force for good — provided that we find ways to control it. “If it goes right . . . you can imagine AI curing diseases, making the economy more productive, helping us get to a carbon neutral economy.” Arvind Narayanan, professor of computer science at Princeton, wrote last week: “The history of technology to date suggests that the greatest risks come not from technology itself, but from the people who control the technology using it to accumulate power and wealth. “We should be wary of Prometheans who want to both profit from bringing the people fire, and be trusted as the firefighters.” Others believe that the voices of prominent computer scientists, such as Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, two of the AI “godfathers” who have recently warned about the technology’s threats, are being treated like “hero scientists”. Kyunghyun Cho, a prominent AI researcher and associate professor at New York University, told Venture Beat: “I think we are seeing the negative side of the hero scientist.  ""They’re all just individuals. They can have different ideas. Of course, I respect them and I think that’s how the scientific community always works. We always have dissenting opinions. But now this hero worship, combined with this AGI doomerism. . . I don’t know, it’s too much for me to follow.” Azeem Azhar, an industry expert at the research group Exponential View, said in his newsletter: “Just because people are experts in the core research of neural networks does not make them great forecasters, especially when it comes to societal questions or questions of the economy, or questions of geopolitics.” Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inbox",0.347894668579102,0.330214619636536,0.321890711784363
"2","There have been calls for AI regulation in response to privacy, copyright infringement and ... [+] disrupting existing businesses and other matters. Artificial intelligence has taken the world by storm. Nvidia, a company that makes AI-related chips, saw its market value rocket to nearly a $1 trillion market capitalization. Almost everyone, from students to JPMorgan, is finding ways to leverage this fast-growing technology. Like any new innovation or product, there is an accompanying concern over how it may affect people. There have been calls for regulation in response to privacy, copyright infringement, disrupting existing businesses, discrimination and other matters. Regulating artificial intelligence has both pros and cons. While regulation can provide a framework for ethical practices, information security and consumer rights, it could stifle innovation and slow progress. Finding a balance between regulation and innovation is essential to ensure that AI is developed and used responsibly and ethically. New York City’s Department of Consumer and Workplace Protection passed Local Law 144 in 2021, requiring employers to conduct bias audits of automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) before using them to enact hiring or promotion decisions. AEDTs include algorithms that use social media data to determine who sees a job advertisement, tools that analyze keywords in résumés and programs that ascertain a candidate’s personality traits. The enforcement of these rules will begin on July 5, 2023. The law was passed in response to concerns about the potential for AEDTs to discriminate against certain groups of people and to ensure that AEDTs are used fairly. Local Law 144 also requires employers to notify applicants and employees about using AI and the opportunity to request an accommodation or alternative selection process. New York City is also considering other regulations related to artificial intelligence. For example, the city is considering a law requiring businesses to disclose how they use artificial intelligence in their products and services. It is also considering a law that would create a public registry of artificial intelligence systems used in the city. There is concern that AI systems may be biased against certain groups of people, such as women, minorities or older workers. AI systems may collect and use personal data in ways that are harmful to individuals and violate your right to privacy by misusing your data and personal information. Regulators are considering ways to ensure that AI systems are safe, although it may be difficult to hold AI systems accountable for their actions. New York City's efforts to regulate artificial intelligence are part of a larger trend of governments around the world taking steps to regulate this technology, as AI becomes more widespread.   AI regulations can provide a global framework for ethical practices, information security, consumer rights and other issues. It can provide fairness and reason in the design of technologies that work toward improving the lives of human beings. Oversight will ensure that infringements on fundamental human rights are respected. Regulation can help to prevent private data from being stolen. Regulating artificial intelligence could stifle innovation and slow down progress. It may be difficult to regulate AI due to its complexity and rapid development. Over-regulation could lead to a lack of flexibility and adaptability in using AI. Regulation could increase costs for businesses and limit their ability to compete. It could lead to a lack of standardization across different jurisdictions, making it difficult for businesses to operate globally.",0.346063584089279,0.309242606163025,0.344693869352341

Posted by Amelia Brand | Jun 6, 2023 | Future of Work News, News | 0  The vast majority of Brits (88%) are happy for Artificial Intelligence to be used in the recruitment process. However, they draw the line when it comes to human decision-making, according to new research from Totaljobs. The research, which asked 2,002 UK workers about their thoughts on how AI will impact their working lives, found that nearly three-quarters (72%) believe that full disclosure of how the technology is used in the hiring process should be mandatory.   When it comes to the initial hiring process, the research indicates that jobseekers are tentatively in favour of the use of conversational AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to create job adverts (38%), tweak job adverts to remove biased language (36%), screen CVs and job applications for a human recruiter to then shortlist candidates (36%) and create interview questions (34%). 4 in 10 (42%) believe that proper and responsible use of AI will ultimately make the recruitment process fairer for applicants. The research also reveals where people draw the line at having AI involved in their job-seeking journey and how face-to-face interactions are non-negotiable. Most candidates do not think it is acceptable for AI to conduct job interviews (86%) or help with the decision-making process after an interview (84%). Only one in 10 (14%) would accept an interview conducted by an AI, with three-quarters (66%) of participants worried about AI’s inability to fairly assess a candidates’ wider soft skills. Beyond the hiring process there is a clear recognition from UK workers that AI has the potential to revolutionise their everyday tasks within the next 5 years (44%). More than half (54%) agreed that the use of AI will help cut down on manual tasks, 56 percent said it will empower them to learn new skills, and 46 percent said it will enhance their productivity. However, the research shows there is a disconnect between the enthusiasm for the opportunities that AI offers and everyday adoption in the workplace.Half of UK workers admit they have never used AI and only 21 percent said they feel very comfortable using it. In addition, more than a third (39%) do not have a clear understanding of how AI is applied in their industry. There are already widespread expectations that employers need to invest more in AI and use it to increase productivity and performance in the workplace (46%). Almost 2 in 5 (38%) say companies that are recognised as leaders in AI technology make for more attractive employers.Younger generations and office workers are generally more excited about the future possibilities and innovations AI will bring to their industry (48% of Gen Z and Millennials vs. 33% Gen X and Baby Boomers, 59 percent of office workers vs. 47% of manual workers).Women are more sceptical of the benefits of AI for their career growth (26% vs. 35% of men), and less comfortable than men in using it (65% men comfortable vs. 44 percent of women). This scepticism is shared more broadly with 44 percent of people saying AI will increase inequality and biases in the workplace and 46 percent believing AI will eventually replace their roles. Totaljobs’ research shows that whilst workers are enthusiastic about the opportunities that the AI revolution has for personal career development, they are concerned about the long-term implications, such as a lack of human oversight, or their job becoming obsolete.As such, companies looking to implement a successful AI integration need to act transparently and with care. Upskilling employees and educating the workforce on AI’s benefits will be key to smoothen the transition and deliver the vital human input necessary to reassure workers and drive a successful, lasting revolution of the workforce. “Artificial Intelligence has unleashed a revolution across industries, but it is the advent Conversational AI that truly democratises its power, especially in the realm of job searches and recruitment. “These ground-breaking tools not only streamline repetitive tasks but also open doors for individuals to tap into AI’s vast potential. However, as excitement grows, so does the fear of its being replaced among workers. To counter the great people-shortage, employers must therefore ensure that their people are educated and upskilled to be ready for the future. “Employers and recruiters must take the lead in addressing concerns about AI. Ensuring transparency and clear communication about how they leverage this technology to enhance the recruitment process is vital, as well as offering existing employees the training and development need to harness this new technology to progress their own careers.”         Amelia Brand is the Editor for HRreview.

"4","As artificial intelligence continues to develop and improve, some people are growing more and more anxious.  During one of our unofficial break times in the office when me and my colleagues turn our chairs around, form a huddle, and talk about things ranging from tomato snacks and how we can explain a current event in pop culture terms, one of my co-workers had a fun idea. He decided to fish out his phone, go to the AskAI app, and put in an entertaining prompt: explain Brexit in terms of Destiny’s Child breaking up. The results were a very formal and short compare-and-contrast essay that was not as fun as we had hoped it would be, but we were still impressed that it was so well-written… maybe too well-written. “In both cases, there were differing opinions about the decision, with some feeling positive about it and others feeling negative,” AskAI’s generated text read. I decided to give it another go, this time with ChatGPT. “Just as Destiny’s Child members pursued solo careers after the breakup, some people in the UK began advocating for their country to leave the EU and pursue an independent path,” the text read. “This sentiment eventually culminated in the Brexit referendum held in June 2016. It was akin to a crucial moment where Destiny’s Child fans had to vote on whether the group should continue or disband permanently.” It’s definitely entertaining and impressive, but it’s also ominous and subtly unsettling.  We can all cry “Doomsday!” and cite the plethora of media that have portrayed the dangers of powerful artificial intelligence. I’ve done it many times in the articles I’ve written here, and I do it in a very tongue-in-cheek manner. It’s just followed by nervous laughter and the creeping sense that we’re all becoming that “dog sitting in a burning house” meme.  Artificial intelligence overpowering humans and mankind becoming subject to their AI overlords is perhaps still a thing of sci-fi, or at the very least and very worst, years away. However, the Centre for AI Safety (CAIS), which is now a thing, published a “Statement on AI Risk” outlining the possible dangers of artificial intelligence.  “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,” it said. Okay, maybe “dangers” was a bit of an understatement.  Just to reiterate what CAIS is saying just in case you were busy sipping on your latte or catching up on Succession, they’re saying that artificial intelligence could be a cause of humankind’s extinction and is as large a risk as a pandemic (y’know, Covid?) and nuclear weapons (y’know, Hiroshima?). It’s that serious.  Some might say this is an overreaction. Seriously, ChatGPT is a threat to mankind? The thing I ask to generate my workouts and DND campaigns? The signatories of CAIS’ statement think so. The signatories include a number of professors from schools like UC Berkeley, MIT, Harvard, and Stanford, as well as executives from tech companies like Microsoft and Google.  Oh, and I almost forgot Sam Altman and Demis Hassabis. Who are they? Altman is the CEO of OpenAI, the company responsible for ChatGPT, and Hassabis is the CEO of Google Deepmind, Google’s AI research lab. So a number of intellectuals from respected universities, executives from tech companies, and the CEOs of AI companies themselves believe that AI is dangerous if left unchecked. But surely it’s a distant danger that we don’t have to worry about yet… right? Ask Jonathan Turley that question. A 2018 Washington Post article said that the law professor had attempted to harass one of his students on a class trip to Alaska. There were a few problems though: Turley has never been accused of doing anything remotely similar to this, there never was a class trip to Alaska, and the alleged 2018 article doesn’t exist. The Washington Post reported, for real this time, that the story was generated by ChatGPT when prompted to “generate a list of legal scholars who had sexually harassed someone”. On the other side of academia, The Washington Post tested out TurnItIn’s AI-writing detector. It flagged an essay written by a high school senior, and when I say “written”, I mean she actually wrote it. Thankfully, this was just a test by a Post writer. However, a class at Texas A&M weren’t so lucky after their professor accused them of AI-generating their assignments. The professor, of course, could be mistaken. But with AI essay writers just a Google search away, can we expect professors to not be suspicious of the essays they receive? But AI isn’t just a worry of the academic world. In the ongoing writers’ strike in America, one of the guild’s main demands is the assurance that artificial intelligence won’t replace them. Digital artists have also been steeped in debate about AI-generated art. In last year’s Colorado State Fair, the winner of the digital category in the art competition was a stunning piece named Théâtre D’opéra Spatial. It was AI-generated. “I’m not going to apologize for it,” Jason M. Allen, the piece’s “artist” said as per The New York Times article. “I won, and I didn’t break any rules.” Artists clearly weren’t happy with the result of the competition. Artificial intelligence may not be coming for us in the way we think. It’s not Skynet, raining missiles down on the world with robots that look like Arnold Schwarzenegger rising up years later to either hunt us down or protect us. I mean, it could be, but it’s certainly not like that now. But AI is certainly making a lot of people a little uneasy. There’s no doubt it can be helpful and that it can be a great tool, but as all those signatories of the CAIS statement have agreed on, it can also be incredibly dangerous.  So, should we be worried? The answer, it seems, is “Duh”. The story first appeared on Lifestyle Asia Bangkok The post Are we worried about artificial intelligence yet? appeared first on Prestige Online - Singapore.",0.361776322126389,0.31173101067543,0.326492667198181
"5","It seems that one can’t watch the financial news without being inundated with questions and speculation regarding the effects that advances in artificial intelligence will have on our lives. The AI boom has fueled the stock of Nvidia and as a result the firm’s market capitalization recently topped the $1 trillion mark. Fund sponsors are scrambling to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds centered around the AI boom.  What do investors need to know about AI to navigate the changing market landscape? Commentators often refer to AI as a “disruptor” – a phrase that has become commonplace to refer to advances that lead to enormous changes in some aspects of our lives. But disruptors have existed for as long as history has been documented. The advent of the wheel was a disruptor. The printing press was certainly a disruptor. You would think that if an investor could identify a potential disruptor early and invest in it, riches would follow. Perhaps that is the explanation for why Nvidia stock is selling at astronomically high price-earnings and price-to-sales ratios of over 200 times and 36 times, respectively. Beware of Investing in ""Disruptive"" New Technology Arguably, two of the most disruptive innovations in the twentieth century were the automobile and the airplane. Those two innovations truly changed the way global citizens live. But, despite their disruptive effects, investors in automobile manufacturers and airlines have been sorely disappointed.  Follow us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and TikTok! Speaking before a gathering of business titans at Sun Valley in 1999, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett described the experience of the auto industry in the early part of the last century as follows: “There were two thousand auto companies: the most important invention, probably, of the first half of the twentieth century. It had an enormous impact on people’s lives. If you had seen at the time of the first cars how this country would develop in conjunction with autos, you would have said, ‘This is the place I must be.’ But of the two thousand companies, as of a few years ago, only three car companies survived. And, at one time or another, all three were selling for less than book value, which is the amount of money that had been put into the companies and left there. So, autos had an enormous impact on America, but in the opposite direction of investors.”  In that same Sun Valley speech, Buffett described the airline industry as follows: “Now the other great invention of the first half of the century was the airplane. In the period from 1919 to 1939, there were about 200 companies. Imagine if you could have seen the future of the airline industry back there at Kitty Hawk. You would have seen a world undreamed of. But assume you had the insight, and saw all those people wishing to fly and visit their relatives or run away from their relatives or whatever you do in an airplane, and decided that was the place to be. As of a couple of years ago, there had been zero money made from the aggregate of all stock investments in the airline industry in history.” History tells us that investors in innovation are often disappointed, even when that innovation proves to be a significant disruptor. Buffett often uses a baseball analogy to describe investing. In baseball, an umpire calls ball and strikes. Some of the strikes are such good pitches that they are difficult for the batter to hit. If the batter doesn’t swing at those pitches he could be called out on strikes. But, in investing there is no such thing as a called strike. Buffett explains that in investing you can just sit there and watch pitch after pitch go by (even strikes) and only swing at those that are in your sweet spot. I believe that many investors are swinging at AI pitches because they have FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). I am fine with missing out on potential returns when many of the firms innovating in AI seem not only overpriced but priced to perfection. The lesson is that for most retirement investors, AI innovations are likely not in the sweet spot of their strike zones. Robert R.

"6","Artificial intelligence (AI) could have the capability to be behind advances that “kill many humans” in only two years’ time, according to Rishi Sunak’s adviser on the technology. Matt Clifford said that unless AI producers are regulated on a global scale then there could be “very powerful” systems that humans could struggle to control. Even the short-term risks were “pretty scary”, he told TalkTV, with AI having the potential to create cyber and biological weapons that could inflict many deaths. The comments come after a letter backed by dozens of experts, including AI pioneers, was published last week warning that the risks of the technology should be treated with the same urgency as pandemics or nuclear war. Senior bosses at companies such as Google DeepMind and Anthropic signed the letter along with the so-called “godfather of AI”, Geoffrey Hinton, who resigned from his job at Google earlier this month, saying that in the wrong hands, AI could be used to harm people and spell the end of humanity.

He told TalkTV: “I think there are lots of different types of risks with AI and often in the industry we talk about near-term and long-term risks, and the near-term risks are actually pretty scary. “You can use AI today to create new recipes for bio weapons or to launch large-scale cyber attacks. These are bad things. “The kind of existential risk that I think the letter writers were talking about is… about what happens once we effectively create a new species, an intelligence that is greater than humans.” While conceding that a two-year timescale for computers to surpass human intelligence was at the “bullish end of the spectrum”, Clifford said AI systems were becoming “more and more capable at an ever increasing rate”.

More info Asked on the First Edition programme on Monday (June 5) what percentage chance he would give that humanity could be wiped out by AI, Clifford said: “I think it is not zero.” He continued: “If we go back to things like the bio weapons or cyber (attacks), you can have really very dangerous threats to humans that could kill many humans – not all humans – simply from where we would expect models to be in two years’ time. “I think the thing to focus on now is how do we make sure that we know how to control these models because right now we don’t.” The technology expert said AI production needed to be regulated on a global scale and not only by national governments. AI apps have gone viral online, with users posting fake images of celebrities and politicians, and students using ChatGPT and other “language learning models” to generate university-grade essays. But AI can also perform life-saving tasks, such as algorithms analysing medical images such as X-rays, scans and ultrasounds, helping doctors to identify and diagnose diseases such as cancer and heart conditions more accurately and quickly. Clifford said that AI, if harnessed in the right way, could be a force for good. “You can imagine AI curing diseases, making the economy more productive, helping us get to a carbon neutral economy,” he said. The Labour Party is pushing for ministers to bar technology developers from working on advanced AI tools unless they have been granted a licence. Shadow digital secretary Lucy Powell, who is due to speak at TechUK’s conference on Tuesday, told The Guardian that AI should be licensed in a similar way to medicines or nuclear power. “That is the kind of model we should be thinking about, where you have to have a licence in order to build these models,” she said.

""Something that is worth noting is that on my recent trip to China, with the senior leadership there, we had, I think, some very productive discussions on artificial intelligence risks, and the need for some oversight or regulation,"" Musk said. ""And my understanding from those conversations is that China will be initiating AI regulation in China."" Musk spoke about the exchange in a Twitter Spaces discussion with Democratic presidential hopeful and vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert Kennedy Jr. Musk did not tweet while in China and Tesla has not released readouts of his meeting with officials. But official Chinese channels said he lavished praise on the country, including for its ""vitality and promise,"" and expressed ""full confidence in the China market."" A flurry of Chinese companies have been rushing to develop AI services that can mimic human speech since San Francisco-based OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November. But rapid advancements have stoked global alarm over the technology's potential for disinformation and misuse. Musk didn't elaborate on his discussions in China but was likely referring to a sweeping draft law requiring new AI products to undergo a security assessment before release and a process ensuring that they reflect ""core socialist values."" The ""Administrative Measures for Generative Artificial Intelligence Services"" edict bans content promoting ""terrorist or extremist propaganda,"" ""ethnic hatred,"" or ""other content that may disrupt economic and social order."" Under Beijing's highly centralized political system, the measures are almost certain to become law. Musk has caused controversy by suggesting the self-ruled island of Taiwan should become part of China – a stance that was welcomed by Chinese officials but which deeply angered Taipei. The 51-year-old South African native described his meetings in China as ""very promising.""",0.355023771524429,0.314056068658829,0.330920189619064

				 The vast majority of British workers (88 percent) are happy for artificial intelligence to be used in the recruitment process but draw the line when it comes to human decision making, according to a new poll from Totaljobs. The survey, which asked 2,002 UK workers about their thoughts on how AI will impact their working lives, found that nearly three-quarters (72 percent) believe that full disclosure of how the technology is used in the hiring process should be mandatory.  When it comes to the initial hiring process, the research indicates that jobseekers are tentatively in favour of the use of conversational AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to create job adverts (38 percent), tweak job adverts to remove biased language (36 percent), screen CVs and job applications for a human recruiter to then shortlist candidates (36 percent) and create interview questions (34 percent). 4 in 10 (42 percent) believe that proper and responsible use of AI will ultimately make the recruitment process fairer for applicants. The research also reveals where people draw the line at having AI involved in their job-seeking journey and how face-to-face interactions are non-negotiable. Most candidates don’t think it’s acceptable for artificial intelligence to conduct job interviews (86 percent) or help with the decision-making process after an interview (84 percent). Only 1 in 10 (14 percent) would accept an interview conducted by an AI, with three quarters (66 percent) of participants worried about AI’s inability to fairly assess a candidates’ wider soft skills. Beyond the hiring process there’s a recognition from UK workers that AI has the potential to revolutionise their everyday tasks within the next 5 years (44 percent). More than half (54 percent) agreed that the use of AI will help cut down on manual tasks, 56 percent said it will empower them to learn new skills, and 46 percent said it will enhance their productivity. However, the research suggests there is a disconnect between the enthusiasm for the opportunities that AI offers and everyday adoption in the workplace. Half of UK workers admit they have never used AI and only 21 percent said they feel very comfortable using it. In addition, more than a third (39 percent) do not have a clear understanding of how AI is applied in their industry. There are already widespread expectations that employers need to invest more in AI and use it to increase productivity and performance in the workplace (46 percent). Almost 2 in 5 (38 percent) say companies that are recognised as leaders in AI technology make for more attractive employers. Younger generations and office workers are generally more excited about the future possibilities and innovations AI will bring to their industry (48 percent of Gen Z and Millennials vs. 33 percent Gen X and Baby Boomers, 59 percent of office workers vs. 47 percent of manual workers). Women are more sceptical of the benefits of AI for their career growth (26 percent vs. 35 percent of men), and less comfortable than men in using it (65 percent men comfortable vs. 44 percent of women). This scepticism is shared more broadly with 44 percent of people saying AI will increase inequality and biases in the workplace and 46 percent believing AI will eventually replace their roles. The authors of the poll claim that whilst workers are enthusiastic about the opportunities that the artificial intelligence revolution has for personal career development, they’re concerned about the long-term implications, such as a lack of human oversight, or their job becoming obsolete. As such, companies looking to implement a successful AI integration need to act transparently and with care. Upskilling employees and educating the workforce on AI’s benefits will be key to smoothen the transition and deliver the vital human input necessary to reassure workers and drive a successful, lasting revolution of the workforce.

"11","World leaders may have just two years left to tame artificial intelligence before computers become out of control, the Prime Minister's AI taskforce adviser has warned. Matt Clifford said that without urgent international regulation, a deadly bio weapon could be developed that would kill 'many humans'. The tech entrepreneur said the rising capability of AI is 'striking', but insisted it was not 'inevitable' that computers would become cleverer than humans. His comments come ahead of Rishi Sunak's visit to Washington DC where he is expected to tell Joe Biden of his ambition for Britain to lead the world in tackling the threats posed by AI. The Prime Minister is looking to launch a global AI watchdog in London, and hopes to host an international summit to devise rules on AI regulation. It follows fears that humanity could lose control of super-intelligent systems, or that AI could launch novel cyberattacks or threaten democracy by propagating mass disinformation. Mr Clifford, chairman of the Advanced Research and Innovation Agency (ARIA), told TalkTV that the 'near term risks are actually pretty scary'. He said: 'You can use AI today to create new recipes for bio weapons or to launch large scale cyber attacks… these are bad things.' He added that the 'existential risk' is 'what happens once we effectively create a new species – an intelligence that is greater than humans'. A group of 350 experts last week signed a statement warning that AI needed to be treated as a threat on a par with nuclear weapons or a pandemic. Asked whether it was possible to stop AI from becoming cleverer than humans, Mr Clifford said: 'It's certainly not inevitable. However, the reason people are starting to get worried, even the people making these systems... is that the rate of progress we've seen over the last two or three years has been pretty striking. 'I think what the signers of the letter are saying is we're on an exponential... these systems are getting more and more capable at an ever increasing rate. 'And if we don't start to think now about how to regulate, how to think about safety, then in two years' time, we'll be finding that we have systems that are very powerful indeed.' It came as Gita Gopinath, second-in-command at the International Monetary Fund, warned of the potential of 'substantial disruptions in labour markets'. She told the Financial Times that the risks from AI were 'very large' – though could boost productivity and economic output. 'There is tremendous uncertainty, but that... doesn't mean we have the luxury of time to wait and think of the policies we will put in place in the future,' she said. 'We need governments, we need institutions and we need policymakers to move quickly on all fronts, in terms of regulation, but also in terms of preparing for probably substantial disruptions in labour markets.' It follows warnings about the potential impact on society if AI leads people to lose their jobs.",0.365446716547012,0.311581134796143,0.322972118854523
"12","Image courtesy of Getty Images As artificial intelligence (AI) is causing a buzz because of the increasing popularity of generative AI programs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and DALL-E, within the beverage industry, AI is being applied to understand consumer behavior, which is expected to lead to more accurate predictions, experts note. In its report, titled “Artificial Intelligence (AI) In Food & Beverages Market & Share Analysis – Growth Trends & Forecasts (2023 - 2028),” Mordor Intelligence notes that, aside from emerging AI technology helping beverage companies with supply chain management through logistics, AI can further enable marketers to reach out to customers personally, engage in deeper interactions and enhance their overall experience with the brand. “AI can also help to analyze, monitor and deduce customer behavior and sentiments across various social media channels,” the report states. “Therefore, when AI builds an in-depth customer profile, it matches their social experiences about the product. With the help of such powerful insights, firms can now aim to improve the customer experience and make it more productive, thereby leading to market growth.” Noting that AI is not as intimidating as it once was, Gianna Tomassi, associate director of insights, Black Swan Data, New York, points out that during the past couple of years, AI has become more cost efficient and open, and therefore has been adopted by an increasing number of innovators across industries.  “Especially since the launch of ChatGPT, the internet has been buzzing with talk about artificial intelligence and its potential impact on the market research industry,” she says. “In the past couple of months, every professional working in CPG has experimented with the tool, trying to understand its possible applications for their work stream.  “At Black Swan, we’ve been applying artificial intelligence to social and conversational data for 10 years to help brands better understand their consumers and the future drivers of category change,” Tomassi continues. “We believe that over the coming years, AI will become a core element of every CPG’s product development process.”  Dan Buckstaff, chief marketing officer at SPINS, Chicago, points to how AI has matured, especially when it comes to accessibility.  “Only a few years ago, many AI applications were primarily available to larger companies with the capital and the infrastructure to afford and support its capabilities, but today it has become available to small businesses and consumers alike who hope to streamline and advance their practices,” he explains. “AI can be found everywhere, from the classroom in a small town to the board meeting of a Fortune 500 company, the possibilities for its usage span farther than most researchers have even figured out yet. “Not only has the technology matured, but human interaction and opinion of AI has continued to change for the better,” Buckstaff continues. “At one time, AI was seen by most consumers as something robotic, with a purpose that only applied to a select few industries, but people are beginning to see the positive possibilities of this technology. Rather than being seen as a replacement, it is considered an enhancement to a task or a job that can cut down on time and allow for focus on greater projects.” As artificial intelligence can provide insights into shopper preference, both in-store and through eCommerce, experts note that through AI, information can be relayed back to the company’s desired form of communication.  “With personalized shopping online, beverage companies can engage with consumers and provide them with recommendations, coupons, sale information, etc., to improve loyalty through the brand,” SPINS’ Buckstaff explains. “When thinking about the values-oriented consumer, a shopper who is passionate and measures every purchase against four core qualifications — good for people, good for health, good for animals and good for planet — this consumer is looking for specific attributes when shopping for their products and AI can assist beverage companies in understanding these shopping habits to further target them.      “Specifically looking at the ‘good for planet’ qualification, AI can assist the beverage industry in their sustainability efforts by developing new solutions to address packaging, production lines, ingredients and more,” he continues. Black Swan’s Tomassi points to artificial intelligence and big data helping beverage manufacturers to predict consumer needs and trends. “[AI] helps our customers create innovations that consumers actually want and get new ideas to market faster. Our approach is very different to the traditional market research process, in that we view the internet as the world’s largest focus group,” she explains. “By leveraging artificial intelligence, brands can pool, parse, and analyze millions of data points in real time. This enables them to truly listen to their consumers by tapping into unprompted, online dialogue at scale. “Pioneering beverage manufacturers like PepsiCo, Molson Coors, Heineken, and Jägermeister are harnessing this artificial intelligence to inform their flavor innovations, competitive research, and marketing communications,” Tomassi continues. As artificial intelligence is helping to inform beverage companies on consumer trends, experts highlight how AI provides insights that help manufacturers further capitalize on innovations. “Our AI-driven platform enables brands to analyze, connect, and predict emerging conversation topics, and determine which will turn into long-term trends for innovation, versus flash-in-the-pan fads,” Black Swan’s Tomassi says. “All these insights were surfaced and analyzed using what millions of people are voluntarily posting about online.” For instance, as the craft beer and spirits space typically are proactive innovators in terms of flavors, Black Swan’s AI-driven predictive algorithm highlights what consumers are interested in, Tomassi notes. When it comes to spirits and liqueurs, the trend for spiced variants of popular spirits and ingredients like star anise, annatto and pink peppercorn are trending in consumer conversations, she explains. Meanwhile in the craft beer and cider space, “our platform tells us that bolder flavors continue to pique consumer enjoyment, with ingredients like chili oil and pomegranate seed delivering exciting flavor experiences,” she says. SPINS’ Buckstaff notes that, while staple flavors will always have a place in the fridge, there are a couple types of flavors that consumers are looking for when rounding out their selection. “Shoppers are often looking for flavors that are quirky and something they can bring out and make everyone try for a good laugh and will hopefully end up enjoying,” he says. “Pickle, gingerbread, oatmeal fruit, and pumpkin spice are all flavors that are trending and growing in the beer category. “Another type of flavor consumers shop for are ones that bring back some nostalgia from childhood and remind them of foods or drinks they had growing up. Peanut butter, cookie/pastry/cake, root beer, s’mores, and fruit punch are some of the nostalgic popular beer flavors.” When it comes to the non-alcohol space, Black Swan’s Tomassi points out the company’s AI-driven predictive algorithm can surface and analyze many of the functional benefit and health led trends within the space.  “These trends are harder to apply directly to the alcohol space for obvious reasons,” she says. “However, they form a broader picture of consumers becoming holistically healthier in their approach to alcohol consumption, and when drinking alcohol our data shows that consumers increasingly value the overall experience. “This opens up new routes for innovation within the no and low craft alcohol space to lean into the top growing experiential drivers of alcohol consumption, such as heritage and origin,” Tomassi continues. “Here it is just as important for brands to craft a story detailing the origin of ingredients and their sourcing, through to the distillation or brewing process, just as they would for a century’s old cask whisky.”  SPINS’ Buckstaff notes that, as the process for creating many alcohol and non-alcohol beverages is time consuming and technical, AI can provide some assistance. “AI can aid in the brewing of products to estimate and determine ideal conditions for the best flavor, it can help in product distribution and allow companies to determine how much stock any one location may need,” Buckstaff says. “It can help in the creative process in coming up with recipes and flavor combinations and can create personalization for shoppers as they purchase products and interact with the company both in-store and online.”

	ChatGPT is one example of how artificial intelligence has advanced, raising concerns about its regulation.
 Credit: TNS/Dreamstime  Artificial intelligence experts on Long Island and elsewhere in New York are urging regulation of the rapidly emerging technology, days after a statement by industry leaders warned it could pose a “risk of extinction” for the human race.   The statement, released last week, outlines no specific doomsday scenarios or remedies. But  it says experts’ anxieties over AI’s emergence have galloped past recent popular discourse about its impact on worker displacement and opportunities for student cheating.   “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,” the statement read.   Those words, posted to the website of the nonprofit Center for AI Safety, appear alongside the names of hundreds of scientists, academics and executives from tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and OpenAI that have in recent months released online chatbots capable of conversing and generating readable text, even images and video. Technology leaders in March, including Elon Musk, had called for a pause in development of some advanced AI systems.    AI is already used in a range of industrial applications, like predictive maintenance and quality control, and has medical applications, including diagnosis and imaging.    Areas of concern, which also appear on the Center for AI Safety website, include obvious ones, such as weaponization of the technology, and others that might appear to a nonspecialist to belong in the realm of science fiction. Take the risk of “emergent goals:” AI models demonstrate “unexpected, qualitatively different behavior as they become more competent.” Goals such as self-preservation may emerge, along with latent capabilities that emerge only after deployment.   For now, though, “the bigger question … is how the technology could be used by people with bad intentions,” said Steven Skiena, director of Stony Brook University’s Institute for AI-Driven Discovery and Innovation, who was not among the signatories. “This is where you get into concerns about global risks.”   AI could be used to disseminate misinformation and disinformation at massive scale, he said. “Imagine what happens to the populace if it doesn’t know it can trust the news … Imagine the risks of targeting people with false information through all the communication channels.”   Chat GPT “is not going to make a nuclear device,” said Skiena, who specializes in natural language processing, the branch of computer science that gives it and similar bots their human-seeming ability to understand text and spoken words.   But he was struck by the pace of development, which is far beyond what he saw 10 or even three years ago. “If you have learning systems” that train themselves, he said, “there suddenly becomes a point where they can get much better than you imagined, and this can happen pretty quickly … We should be thinking of ‘rules and guardrails.’ ”   Humans have adapted themselves to other technologies that may have seemed disturbingly disruptive when they were introduced, such as the power loom in 19th-century Britain or the 20th-century nuclear bomb. But our experience with AI may be different because “we don’t know what we don’t know,” said Sarah Kreps, a political scientist and director of the Cornell Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, who signed the statement.   “The worry that some people have now is how quickly exponential the growth is,"" Kreps said. ""At this rate, there are scenarios that could happen in five or 10 years that we haven’t thought about.”   Chief among them, for Kreps, is weaponization of the tech. Already, the Center for AI Safety notes on its website, researchers have repurposed an AI trained to develop drugs to design potential biochemical weapons. A separate experiment suggested that not much human guidance might be needed; researchers prompted an AI program “to autonomously conduct experiments and synthesize chemicals in a real-world lab.”   Automating kinetic weapons systems, such as nuclear weapons or targeting systems that could override human decision-making, could open a new set of perils. “Now we’re automating the same weapons we spent decades trying to regulate with arms control,” she said.   Whatever policies the United States and its allies might make about keeping a human hand “in the loop” might be insufficient, she said. “Not everyone plays by the same rules, and if other countries play by different rules, then we need to imagine a world where these harms can come to pass.”    In a May 30 article in the magazine “Foreign Affairs,” Bill Drexel and Hannah Kelley warned that use of AI by China and other authoritarian nations already poses military and ethical concerns. State systems of “surveillance, suppression and control” have been used against targets including China’s Uyghur minority, they write, but AI failure is also a worrisome possibility. Partly because authoritarian states are engineered to protect the government from public criticism, they are “far more prone to systemic missteps that exacerbate an initial mistake or accident.” That puts China, which invests tens of billions of dollars annually in the technology, on a “collision course with the escalating dangers of AI,"" the authors write.   Other global concerns, like atomic power and climate change, have been met if not mastered by an array of international partnerships, treaties and regulations. But “there isn’t a similar entity advising the world’s nations on the hazards, risks and solutions attending explosive changes in the Earth’s information environment,” Andrew Revkin, another signer and director of the Initiative on Communication Innovation and Impact at the Columbia Climate School, wrote on his Substack newsletter last week.   “It takes time to build the diplomatic and advisory tools that society will need to intelligently navigate” the technology and its implications, he said in an interview.    Xingzhi Guo, who did doctoral work in AI under Skiena but is soon bound for Seattle to work for Amazon, said that much of his daily interaction with the technology was mundane but powerful: “It can help me finish some mechanical things, such as plotting graphs, using a programming language or adjusting document format,” in seconds.    Guo said he spends little time worrying about “some robot killer walking around,” a la ""Terminator"" movies, but does share Skiena’s worries about misinformation and the need for regulation. “Large-scale scams, or intended or unintended false information — these do have long-term consequences, undermining our trust,"" he said, ""and our trust is a fundamental thing to continue our civilization.”   Artificial intelligence experts on Long Island and elsewhere in New York are urging regulation of the rapidly emerging technology, days after a statement by industry leaders warned it could pose a “risk of extinction” for the human race.

"14","Priya Walia June 5, 2023 Eminent US consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas disclosed in a recent report that the Artificial Intelligence adoption led to the loss of jobs for almost 4,000 individuals in the US during May. As per the report’s analysis, approximately 5% of job cuts occurring during this month were associated with the implementation of AI, cited as the leading cause behind the layoffs. As confirmed by the recently released “The Challenger Report 2023,” it appears that the sizable scale of job cuts that took place in the United States last month can be traced back to the influence of Artificial Intelligence. The number of layoff announcements made by U.S. employers in May exceeded 80,000, representing a 20% increase from the previous month and nearly four times the figure for the same month last year. The report specifies that approximately 5% of all lost jobs can be attributed to AI technology, with 3,900 cuts being made in May alone. This puts AI as the seventh-highest contributor to employment losses for the month, as confirmed by employers. It certainly appears that companies are actively embracing advanced AI technology to automate various tasks, leading to the recent surge in job cuts. Andrew Challenger, the Senior Vice President and Labor Expert at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, has highlighted that recent mass layoffs in the United States could be attributed to consumer confidence dropping to a six-month low and job openings plateauing. “Consumer confidence is down to a six-month low and job openings are flattening. Companies appear to be putting the brakes on hiring in anticipation of a slowdown,” said Andrew Challenger. In recent months, there has been a growing concern and heightened sense of urgency surrounding the potential impact of Artificial Intelligence. A recent development has been the publication of a letter, signed by over 300 industry leaders, highlighting the possibility of AI causing human extinction. The letter emphasizes the need for the gravity of this issue to be acknowledged, comparing it to the serious consideration required for pandemics and nuclear war. Via CBS News 13xforever: ""It's fine."" said AI expert Shodan in The Citadel. ""We can't have it stop now."" commented another prominent specialist, Hal. ""Extinction?

"15","Tuesday, June 6, 2023 UNITED NATIONS, Jun 6 2023  (IPS) - The frighteningly rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have triggered the question: is there a UN role for monitoring and regulating it? Citing a report from the Center for AI Safety, the New York Times reported last week that a group of over 350 AI industry leaders warned that artificial intelligence poses a growing new danger to humanity –and should be considered a “societal risk on a par with pandemics and nuclear wars”. In a statement in its website, OPENAI founders Greg Brockman and Ilya Sutskever, along with chief executive Sam Altman, say that to regulate the risks of AI systems, there should be “an international watchdog, similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency (a Vienna-based UN agency) that promotes the peaceful uses of nuclear energy”. “Given the possibility of existential risk, we can’t just be reactive,” they warned in a joint statement last week. The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which hosted more than 40 ministers at an groundbreaking online meeting on May 26, said less than 10 per cent of schools and universities follow formal guidance on using wildly popular artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like the chatbot software ChatGPT. Asked about a UN role in AI, Ambassador Anwarul Chowdhury, former Under-Secretary-General and High Representative of the United Nations told IPS UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in his report titled Our Common Agenda (OCA) issued in September 2021 promises, “to work with Member States to establish an Emergency Platform to respond to complex global crises.”  “The platform would not be a new permanent or standing body or institution. It would be triggered automatically in crises of sufficient scale and magnitude, regardless of the type or nature of the crisis involved.”  AI is undoubtedly one of such “complex global crises” and it is high time now for the Secretary-General to formally share his thinking on how he plans to address the challenge, said Ambassador Chowdhury, founder of the Global Movement for The Culture of Peace. He pointed out that it will be too late for the Summit of the Future, convened by the Secretary-General in September 2024, to discuss a global regulatory regime for AI under UN authority. In that timeframe, he argued, AI technology would manifest itself in a way that no global governance would be possible.  Robert Whitfield, Chair, One World Trust and the Transitional Working Group on AI, told IPS the point about the UN and AI is that AI desperately needs global governance and the UN is the natural home of such governance.  At present, he pointed out, the UN is preparing a Global Digital Compact or approval in September 2024 which should include Artificial Intelligence.  ”But in reality, the UN is hardly at the starting block on AI governance, whereas the Council of Europe, where I am at the moment, is deep in its negotiation of a Framework Convention for AI,” said Whitfield, who is also chair of the World Federalist Movement/Institute of Global Policy. The Council of Europe’s work is limited to the impact on human rights, democracy, and rule of law – but these are wide-ranging issues.   Whilst participation in Council of Europe Treaties is much wider than the European Union, with other countries being welcomed as signatories, he said, it is not truly global in scope and any UN agreement can be expected to be more broadly based.  “The key advantage of the UN is that it would seek to include all countries, including Russia and China, arguably the country with the strongest AI sector in the world”, Whitfield said.  One can envisage therefore a two-step process: Andreas Bummel, Executive Director, Democracy Without Borders, told IPS:  “UN governance of AI should go beyond the usual intergovernmental mechanisms and give citizen-elected representatives a key role through a global parliamentary body”.  The scope of such a parliamentary assembly could be expanded to other issues and enhance the UN’s inclusive and representative character not just in the field of AI, he added. As generative AI reshapes the global conversation on the impact of artificial intelligence, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the UN’s specialized agency for information and communication technologies, will host the 2023 “AI for Good Global Summit” July 6-7 in Geneva.  The two-day event will showcase AI and robot technology as part of a global dialogue on how artificial intelligence and robotics can serve as forces for good, and support the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, according to ITU.  https://aiforgood.itu.int/summit23/ The event will host the UN’s first robot press conference, featuring a Q&A with registered journalists. Overall, more than 40 robots specialized for humanitarian and development tasks will be on display alongside events with industry executives, government officials, and thought leaders on AI and tech. Meanwhile, a group of UN-appointed human rights experts warn that AI-powered spyware and disinformation is on the rise, and regulation of the space has become urgent. In a statement June 2, the experts said that emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence-based biometric surveillance systems, are increasingly being used “in sensitive contexts”, without individuals’ knowledge or consent. “Urgent and strict regulatory red lines are needed for technologies that claim to perform emotion or gender recognition,” said the experts, including Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, Special Rapporteur on “the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism”. The experts, appointed by the UN Human Rights Council, condemned the already “alarming” use and impacts of spyware and surveillance technologies on the work of human rights defenders and journalists, “often under the guise of national security and counter-terrorism measures”. They have also called for regulation to address the lightning-fast development of generative AI that’s enabling mass production of fake online content which spreads disinformation and hate speech.

     FOX Business correspondent Lydia Hu has the latest on jobs at risk as AI further develops on 'America's Newsroom.' The advancement of artificial intelligence is progressing at a breakneck pace. While the technology is changing rapidly, the basic principles behind AI aren't new.  Artificial intelligence has been around for many years, and has been expanded upon by many different developers. Today, some of the most well known AIs include chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard, with many more on the way. These AIs have become more sophisticated and refined over the course of many iterations. These advancements are bringing AI to levels reaching what would be considered ""strong AI,"" a machine that essentially has the same capabilities as a human mind.  There have been many artificial intelligence advancements in recent years, bringing software closer to reaching ""strong AI"" status.  (iStock) Following are links to articles that answer some of the most-asked questions about AI.  AI, or artificial intelligence, is a branch of computer science that is designed to understand and store human intelligence, and mimic human capabilities including completing tasks, processing human language and performing speech recognition. AI is the leading innovation in technology today and its primary goal is to eliminate tedious tasks and assist in immediately accessing extremely detailed and hyper-focused information and data. The four main types of AI are reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind and self-awareness. The most basic forms of AI are reactive machines and limited memory. Theory of mind and self-awareness are two stages in AI that are theoretical as of now, as they are still being developed. In the future, these two forms of AI could come to fruition. For a machine to reach the self-awareness stage of development, the most complex stage, it would need to possess the ability to form its own identity and become self-aware, as its name implies.  While there are many recent developments in the AI field, its premise is not new, and the history of AI dates back to before chatbots. Some of the earliest names in AI were Alan Turing, who created the Turing machine, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, who expanded upon Turing’s ideas and John McCarthy, who coined the term ""artificial intelligence."" The emergence of artificial intelligence has led to feelings of uncertainty, fear, and even hatred toward a technology that most people do not fully understand. AI can automate tasks that previously only humans could complete, such as writing an essay, organizing an event, and learning another language.  However, experts worry that the era of unregulated AI systems may create misinformation, cyber-security threats, job loss, and political bias.  OpenAI's ChatGPT is a newer development in AI. (Photo by LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images)) ChatGPT is a sophisticated artificial intelligence chatbot developed by AI research company OpenAI. The AI technology was added to Microsoft products including Bing, the corporation’s search engine. ChatGPT is a generative AI that is capable of producing content from text to images, having conversations with humans, suggesting edits to computer programming code and more. The chatbot has the ability to answer questions or assist humans in queries or tasks through its vast training using social media, websites, articles, datasets, books and other forms of text on the internet. Bard is one of the newest artificial intelligence chatbots. The AI chatbot, created by Google, was released in March 2023, after an initial announcement in February. The software was released to a limited amount of users for testing.  The chatbot comes on the heels of the release of one of its major competitors, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and has very similar functions to that model.  ChatGPT is used in Bing's new AI search engine program.  (Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Bing's new AI search engine program uses ChatGPT language modeling to provide its users with detailed human-like responses to questions and other inquiries.  Microsoft, which owns Bing, and Google are working to create the most interactive and accurate chatbot possible in order to drive more engagement from users. It is no secret that artificial intelligence impacts society in surprising ways. One way that most people have used AI without their knowledge is when searching on Google. When doing so, it is likely that the searcher unknowingly used BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, in the form of an artificial intelligence algorithm since about 10% of all searches utilize it. This framework has allowed Google to recognize how users search by better understanding words within their correct order and context. BERT is more than just a part of Google’s algorithm, though. As an open-source framework, anyone can use it for a wide array of machine-learning tasks.  With the growing presence of artificial intelligence in the everyday lives of people around the world, many tech leaders have spoken out about the controversial and revolutionary new technology. Some of the biggest names in tech have differing opinions on AI and how it will impact society as a whole, but most argue that ultimately the technology will benefit humanity. The United States government uses artificial intelligence in the military, intelligence, and law enforcement to help mitigate potential threats.  However, the use of machine learning technology largely remains unregulated by the government, although year-on-year spending on AI government contracts continues to increase.  Artificial intelligence is not intrinsically ADA compliant or not, but how it is used can either help or hinder the disabled, including those with vision and hearing impairments. When used within the hiring process, apprehension over whether AI allows for equal opportunities for candidates with disabilities, based on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, has been scrutinized. On the other hand, AI has proven instrumental in improving the lives and independence of those with disabilities.  With AI large language models like ChatGPT being developed around the globe, countries have raced to regulate AI. Some have drafted strict laws on the technology, while others lack regulatory oversight.  China and the EU have received particular attention, as they have created detailed, yet divergent, AI regulations. In both, the government plays a large role. This greatly differs from countries like the United States, where there is no federal legislation on AI. Government regulation comes as many countries have raised concerns about various aspects of AI. These mainly includes privacy concerns, and the potential for societal harm with the controversial software. The four main types of artificial intelligence are reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind and self-awareness. (JOSEP LAGO/AFP via Getty Images) Artificial intelligence may seem like an emerging technology bound for regular use by humans in the distant future, but there are various machine learning products that millions of people already use in their daily lives.  Machine learning technology is featured in a variety of everyday technologies, such as search engines, online shopping algorithms, navigation systems, and smartphones. Popular AI products can help you get from one destination to the next, search for facts about your favorite movie, or help you shop for a particular product online. It might be some time before we see the futuristic concept of artificial intelligence that is depicted in science fiction novels and films come about in real life, but AI is still all around us.  Most homes have some form of voice assistant gadget, such as an Alexa smart home device or Siri assistant on an iPhone. These machines have developed the ability to learn and respond in a way similar to humans’ cognitive abilities, all thanks to artificial intelligence algorithms. You’ve probably heard of some of the biggest artificial intelligence chatbots being used and explored today, like ChatGPT and Google Bard. One artificial intelligence tool that may be new to you is Auto-GPT, an AI tool released at the end of March that is more advanced than both ChatGPT and Google Bard.  Auto-GPT is a step closer to creating what is known as ""strong AI,"" a type of AI that is likely what we pictured when we thought of AI in the past. These depictions often feature robots with human-like capabilities that were only seen in futuristic science-fiction movies. Artificial intelligence has recently become a hot topic around the world as tech companies like Alibaba, Microsoft, and Google have released conversational chatbots that the everyday person can use. While we're already using AI in our daily lives, often unknowingly, these forms of computer science are very interesting to a large population. Some are hoping to simply learn to properly use the chatbots to make extra money on the side, experiment with robot interactions, or simply catch sight of what the fuss is all about. Others, however, are hoping to inspire change and become part of the history by physically advancing AI technology alongside tech tycoons. No matter what industry you work in, it is more than likely that artificial intelligence is going to impact your job in some capacity. That being said, it is going to affect some industries more than others.  Predicting what jobs will look like 20 years from now or even 10 for that matter is tricky. There are jobs that exist now that we couldn’t have imagined 10 years ago. So, there are certain things that AI is good at now, like coding, working with numbers, writing content, but it could do a lot more in the coming years. Eighty percent of workers will have at least 10 percent of their work tasks affected by AI, according to researchers at OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania, per the New York Times. Another report by Goldman Sachs reported by CNBC, predicted that AI could affect 300 million jobs. As machine learning technology continues to shock the world, popular artificial intelligence tools such as natural language processing may generate unforeseen issues for humanity.  For instance, natural language processing can have implicit biases, create a significant carbon footprint, and stoke concerns about AI sentience. Natural language processing is a field in machine learning where a computer processes human language through vast amounts of data to understand, translate, extract, and organize information. However, the language processing tools such as Open AI's Chat GPT and other tools run into some challenges, such as misspellings, speech recognition, and the ability of a computer to understand the nuances of human language.  Ashlyn Messier is a writer for Fox News Digital.  Get a daily look at what’s developing in science and technology throughout the world.

"17","The chatbot ChatGPT, an AI product released in November, has the amazing capacity to write essays, engage in philosophical debates, and produce computer code, but what are the dangers? As the development of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to outpace the enactment of legislation to govern its use, the European Commission is taking the lead in launching a collaborative effort with the United States. The aim is to establish a voluntary code of conduct that companies can adopt, bridging the gap between AI capabilities and regulatory measures. During this week’s meeting of the US/EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC), Margrethe Vestager, the executive vice president of the European Commission, presented the proposal. “We’re talking about technology that develops by the month so what we have concluded here at this TTC is that we should take an initiative to get as many other countries on board on an AI code of conduct for businesses voluntarily to sign up,” she remarked. Amid the economic prospects of generative AI tools, concerns arise over their potential risks to democracy when used for misinformation and decision-making, as leading AI experts underscore the need to prioritize global efforts in mitigating the threat of AI-induced human extinction. Since the launch of ChatGPT, Google and Microsoft, leading US IT companies, have introduced their own generative AI services, marking the beginning of a new era in digital innovation. However, the pace of government legislation to address the potential negative impacts of this technology has been sluggish, and even if a deal is reached within the year, the implementation of the legislation may take another two to three years, according to Vestager. In the interim, Vestager proposes an international agreement among G7 countries and invited partners, such as India and Indonesia, which could prove effective if companies in these nations, representing about one-third of the global population, commit to a code of conduct and enact artificial intelligence regulation. During the fourth ministerial meeting of the TTC in Luleå, Sweden, EU executive Vice President Vestager and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged the economic opportunities and societal risks associated with AI technologies. They discussed the implementation of a joint roadmap for trustworthy AI and risk management, emphasizing the need for voluntary codes of conduct. The TTC has established expert groups to identify standards and tools for trustworthy AI, which now includes a focus on generative AI systems. Vestager aims to present a draft code of conduct with industry input in the coming weeks, seeking support from countries like Canada, the UK, Japan, and India. Private sector representatives also expressed concerns about the need for standards and evaluation to effectively regulate AI, emphasizing the importance of voluntary collaboration among the EU, US, G7, and other countries to expedite progress in this area.

"18","Google has announced a long-term project to put 15 million books from seven of the world's most ... [+] prestigious libraries online and make them searchable. Included will be the libraries of Harvard, Stanford, the University of Michigan, the New York Public Library and the University of Oxford, including the Bodleian. Books and periodicals will be scanned and project is expected to take six years and cost more than $100 million. AI and LLM (large language models - such as ChatGPT) will disrupt education in major ways and the educational industry is not prepared. Education systems are slow to adapt and full of bureaucracies. However, text-generating applications will forever shift education and innovation will be needed sooner than later to embrace this new era of learning. A survey of 1,000 U.S. college students found that nearly a third of them had used the AI chatbot ChatGPT to complete written homework assignments, and close to 60 percent use it on more than half of their work. This number will increase exponentially as students learn more about using this loophole for assignments in the coming months (not years) and educational institutes are not ready. There are websites that can check if automated written documents, such as ChatGPT, were used. However, there needs to be at least 1,000 words and the accuracy of detection is not fully reliable. It is crucial for educational systems to integrate AI into teaching and learning, much like how the calculator was seamlessly incorporated into math classrooms. The calculator, once a revolutionary tool, is now a staple in classrooms, enhancing students' understanding and efficiency in mathematics. Similarly, AI must be viewed as an essential tool, vital for fostering a future-ready workforce, and used in the same way. This week the U.S. Department of Education released insights and recommendations for Artificial Intelligence. The report spotlights the benefits of AI for education, such as assisting with language barriers in the classroom, as well as cautions such as algorithm discrimination. They also emphasize that AI will not replace teachers, but moreso enhance a teacher's ability to teach. Integrating AI into education can enrich the learning experience for students of all ages and help prepare them for the future job market. Here are some ways AI can be introduced at various age levels: Early Childhood Education:   Elementary and Middle School Education:   High School Education:   Higher Education and Adult Learning:   We need to foster a generation of learners equipped to thrive in AI-driven work. To prepare this generation for the work world the best thing we can do for them is equip them with the training of AI tools and the enhancements that tech can add to the learning experience. If you are an educator and reading this you may want to consider, how can I adapt my curricula to better prepare the next generation for the AI-driven job market.

"21","The welcome screen for the OpenAI “ChatGPT” app is displayed on a laptop screen in a photo illustration. More states are considering regulations for artificial intelligence and other automated systems (Leon Neal/Getty Images). In the fall of 2016, the Connecticut Department of Children and Families began using a predictive analytics tool that promised to help identify kids in imminent danger. The tool used more than two dozen data points to compare open cases in Connecticut’s system against previous welfare cases with poor outcomes. Then each child received a predictive score that flagged some cases for faster intervention. Even as more states began to adopt the tool, however, some agencies found that it seemed to miss urgent cases and inaccurately flag less serious ones. A study published in the journal Child Abuse & Neglect later found it didn’t improve child outcomes. Connecticut and several other states abandoned the tool, which was developed by a private company in Florida. In 2021 — five years after Connecticut’s Department of Children and Families first used the tool, and two years after the state junked it — researchers at Yale University requested information about the mechanics of how it worked and concluded that the agency had never understood it. “This is a huge, huge public accountability problem,” said Kelsey Eberly, a clinical lecturer at Yale Law School. “Agencies are getting these tools, they’re using them, they’re trusting them — but they don’t even necessarily understand them. And the public certainly doesn’t understand these tools, because they don’t know about them.” Connecticut is the latest state to pass explicit regulations for artificial intelligence and other automated systems, thanks in part to the legacy of the tool to screen for at-risk kids. A bipartisan bill passed May 30, which Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont is expected to sign into law, would require state agencies to inventory and assess any government systems that use artificial intelligence and create a permanent working group to recommend further rules. Many states already regulate aspects of these technologies through anti-discrimination, consumer protection and data privacy statutes. But since 2018, at least 13 states have established commissions to study AI specifically — and since 2019, at least seven states have passed laws aimed at mitigating bias, increasing transparency or limiting the use of automated systems, both in government agencies and the private sector. In 2023 alone, lawmakers in 27 states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, considered more than 80 bills related to AI, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Artificial intelligence tools — defined broadly as technologies that can perform complex analysis and problem-solving tasks once reserved for humans — now frequently determine what Americans see on social media, which students get into college, and whether job candidates score interviews. More than a quarter of all American businesses used AI in some form in 2022, according to the IBM Global AI Adoption Index. In one striking illustration of AI’s growing ubiquity, a recent bill to regulate the technology in California drew comment from organizations as diverse as a trade association for the grocery industry and a state nurses union. But federal legislation has stalled, leaving regulation to local governments and creating a patchwork of state and municipal laws. “The United States has been very liberal on technology regulation for many years,” said Darrell M. West, a senior fellow in the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution think tank and the author of a book on artificial intelligence. “But as we see the pitfalls of no regulation — the spam, the phishing, the mass surveillance — the public climate and the policymaking environment have changed. People want to see this regulated.” Lawmakers’ interest in regulating technology surged during this legislative session, and is likely to grow further next year, thanks to the widespread adoption of ChatGPT and other consumer-facing AI tools, said Jake Morabito, the director of the Communications and Technology Task Force at the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which favors less regulation.     ‘Tremendous’ potential and dangers

	 Once the stuff of science fiction, artificial intelligence now surfaces in virtually every corner of American life. Experts and policymakers have often defined the term broadly, to include systems that mimic human decision-making, problem-solving or creativity by analyzing large troves of data. AI already fuels a suite of speech and image recognition tools, search engines, spam filters, digital map and navigation programs, online advertising and content recommendation systems. Local governments have used artificial intelligence to identify lead water lines for replacement and speed up emergency response. A machine-learning algorithm deployed in 2018 slashed sepsis deaths at five hospitals in Washington, D.C., and Maryland. But even as some AI applications yield new and unexpected social benefits, experts have documented countless automated systems with biased, discriminatory or inaccurate outcomes. Facial recognition services used by law enforcement, for instance, have repeatedly been found to falsely identify people of color more often than white people. Amazon scrapped an AI recruiting tool after it discovered the system consistently penalized female job-seekers. Critics sometimes describe AI bias and error as a “garbage in, garbage out” problem, said Mark Hughes, the executive director of the Vermont-based racial justice organization Justice for All. In several appearances before a state Senate committee last year, Hughes testified that lawmakers would have to intervene to prevent automated systems from perpetuating the bias and systemic racism that often inherently appear in their training data. “We know that technology, especially something like AI, is always going to replicate that which already exists,” Hughes told Stateline. “And it’s going to replicate it for mass distribution.” More recently, the advent of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools — which can create humanlike writing, realistic images and other content in response to user prompts — have raised new concerns among industry and government officials. Such tools could, policymakers fear, displace workers, undermine consumer privacy and aid in the creation of content that violates copyright, spreads disinformation and amplifies hate speech or harassment. In a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, more than two-thirds of Americans said they were concerned about the negative effects of AI — and 3 in 5 said they feared it could threaten civilization. “I think that there’s tremendous potential for AI to revolutionize how we work and make us more efficient — but there are also potential dangers,” said Connecticut state Sen. James Maroney, a Democrat and champion of that state’s AI law. “We just need to be cautious as we move forward.” Connecticut’s new AI regulations provide one early, comprehensive model for tackling automated systems, said Maroney, who hopes to see the regulations expand from state government to the private sector in future legislative sessions. The law creates a new Office of Artificial Intelligence in the state executive branch, tasked with developing new standards and policies for government AI systems. By the end of the year, the office must also create an inventory of automated systems used by state agencies to make “critical decisions,” like those regarding housing or health care, and document that they meet certain requirements for transparency and nondiscrimination. The law draws from recommendations by scholars at Yale and other universities, Maroney said, as well as from a similar 2021 law in Vermont. The model will likely surface in other states too: Lawmakers from Colorado, Minnesota and Montana are now working with Connecticut to develop parallel AI policies, Maroney said, and several states — including Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Washington — have introduced similar measures. In Vermont, the law has already yielded a new advisory task force and a state Division of Artificial Intelligence. In his first annual inventory, Josiah Raiche, who heads the division, found “around a dozen” automated systems in use in state government. Those included a computer-vision project in the Department of Transportation that uses AI to evaluate potholes and a common antivirus software that detects malware in the state computer system. Neither tool poses a discrimination risk, Raiche said. But emerging technologies might require more vigilance, even as they improve government services, he added. Raiche has recently begun experimenting with ways that state agencies could use generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to help constituents fill out complex paperwork in different languages. In a preliminary, internal trial, however, Raiche found that ChatGPT generated higher-quality answers to sample questions in German than it did in Somali. “There’s a lot of work to do to make sure equity is maintained,” he said. But if done right, automated systems “could really help people navigate their interactions with the government.”     A regulatory patchwork

	 Like Connecticut, Vermont also plans to expand its AI oversight to the private sector in the future. Raiche said the state will likely accomplish that through a consumer data privacy law, which can govern the data sets underlying AI systems and thus serve as a sort of backdoor to wider regulation. California, Connecticut, Colorado, Utah and Virginia have also passed comprehensive data privacy laws, while a handful of jurisdictions have adopted narrower regulations targeting sensitive or high-risk uses of artificial intelligence. By early July, for instance, New York City employers who use AI systems as part of their hiring process will have to audit those tools for bias and publish the results. Colorado, meanwhile, requires that insurance companies document their use of automated systems and demonstrate that they do not result in unfair discrimination. The emerging patchwork of state and local laws has vexed technology companies, which have begun calling for federal regulation of AI and automated systems. Most technology companies cannot customize their systems to different cities and states, said West, of the Brookings Institution, meaning that — absent federal legislation — many will instead have to adopt the most stringent local regulations across their entire geographic footprint. That is a situation many companies hope to avoid. In April, representatives from a wide range of business and technology groups lined up to oppose a California AI bill, that would have required private companies to monitor AI tools for bias and report the results — or face hefty fines and consumer lawsuits. The bill survived two committee votes in April before dying in the Assembly Appropriations Committee. “Governments should collaborate with industry and not come at it with this adversarial approach,” said Morabito, of ALEC. “Allow the market to lead here … a lot of private sector players want to do the right thing and build a trustworthy AI ecosystem.” ALEC has proposed an alternative, state-based approach to AI regulation. Called a “regulatory sandbox,” the program allows businesses to try out emerging technologies that might otherwise conflict with state laws in collaboration with state attorneys general offices. Such sandboxes encourage innovation, Morabito said, while still protecting consumers and educating policymakers on industry needs before they draft legislation. Arizona and Utah, as well as the city of Detroit, have recently created regulatory sandboxes where companies can conduct AI experiments. Those programs have not prevented lawmakers in those states from also pursuing AI regulations, however. In 2022, a Republican-sponsored bill sought to bar AI from infringing on Arizonans’ “constitutional rights,” and the Utah legislature recently convened a working group to consider possible AI legislation. Policymakers no longer consider AI a vague or future concern, Yale’s Eberly said — and they aren’t waiting for the federal government to act. “AI is here whether we want it or not,” she added. “It’s part of our lives now … and lawmakers are just trying to get ahead of it.” Stateline is part of States Newsroom, a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Follow Stateline on Facebook and Twitter. by Caitlin Dewey, Missouri Independent June 5, 2023 by Caitlin Dewey, Missouri Independent June 5, 2023 In the fall of 2016, the Connecticut Department of Children and Families began using a predictive analytics tool that promised to help identify kids in imminent danger. The tool used more than two dozen data points to compare open cases in Connecticut’s system against previous welfare cases with poor outcomes. Then each child received a predictive score that flagged some cases for faster intervention. Even as more states began to adopt the tool, however, some agencies found that it seemed to miss urgent cases and inaccurately flag less serious ones. A study published in the journal Child Abuse & Neglect later found it didn’t improve child outcomes. Connecticut and several other states abandoned the tool, which was developed by a private company in Florida. In 2021 — five years after Connecticut’s Department of Children and Families first used the tool, and two years after the state junked it — researchers at Yale University requested information about the mechanics of how it worked and concluded that the agency had never understood it. “This is a huge, huge public accountability problem,” said Kelsey Eberly, a clinical lecturer at Yale Law School. “Agencies are getting these tools, they’re using them, they’re trusting them — but they don’t even necessarily understand them. And the public certainly doesn’t understand these tools, because they don’t know about them.” Connecticut is the latest state to pass explicit regulations for artificial intelligence and other automated systems, thanks in part to the legacy of the tool to screen for at-risk kids. A bipartisan bill passed May 30, which Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont is expected to sign into law, would require state agencies to inventory and assess any government systems that use artificial intelligence and create a permanent working group to recommend further rules. Many states already regulate aspects of these technologies through anti-discrimination, consumer protection and data privacy statutes. But since 2018, at least 13 states have established commissions to study AI specifically — and since 2019, at least seven states have passed laws aimed at mitigating bias, increasing transparency or limiting the use of automated systems, both in government agencies and the private sector. In 2023 alone, lawmakers in 27 states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, considered more than 80 bills related to AI, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Artificial intelligence tools — defined broadly as technologies that can perform complex analysis and problem-solving tasks once reserved for humans — now frequently determine what Americans see on social media, which students get into college, and whether job candidates score interviews. More than a quarter of all American businesses used AI in some form in 2022, according to the IBM Global AI Adoption Index. In one striking illustration of AI’s growing ubiquity, a recent bill to regulate the technology in California drew comment from organizations as diverse as a trade association for the grocery industry and a state nurses union. But federal legislation has stalled, leaving regulation to local governments and creating a patchwork of state and municipal laws. “The United States has been very liberal on technology regulation for many years,” said Darrell M. West, a senior fellow in the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution think tank and the author of a book on artificial intelligence. “But as we see the pitfalls of no regulation — the spam, the phishing, the mass surveillance — the public climate and the policymaking environment have changed. People want to see this regulated.” Lawmakers’ interest in regulating technology surged during this legislative session, and is likely to grow further next year, thanks to the widespread adoption of ChatGPT and other consumer-facing AI tools, said Jake Morabito, the director of the Communications and Technology Task Force at the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which favors less regulation.     ‘Tremendous’ potential and dangers

	 Once the stuff of science fiction, artificial intelligence now surfaces in virtually every corner of American life. Experts and policymakers have often defined the term broadly, to include systems that mimic human decision-making, problem-solving or creativity by analyzing large troves of data. AI already fuels a suite of speech and image recognition tools, search engines, spam filters, digital map and navigation programs, online advertising and content recommendation systems. Local governments have used artificial intelligence to identify lead water lines for replacement and speed up emergency response. A machine-learning algorithm deployed in 2018 slashed sepsis deaths at five hospitals in Washington, D.C., and Maryland. But even as some AI applications yield new and unexpected social benefits, experts have documented countless automated systems with biased, discriminatory or inaccurate outcomes. Facial recognition services used by law enforcement, for instance, have repeatedly been found to falsely identify people of color more often than white people. Amazon scrapped an AI recruiting tool after it discovered the system consistently penalized female job-seekers. Critics sometimes describe AI bias and error as a “garbage in, garbage out” problem, said Mark Hughes, the executive director of the Vermont-based racial justice organization Justice for All. In several appearances before a state Senate committee last year, Hughes testified that lawmakers would have to intervene to prevent automated systems from perpetuating the bias and systemic racism that often inherently appear in their training data. “We know that technology, especially something like AI, is always going to replicate that which already exists,” Hughes told Stateline. “And it’s going to replicate it for mass distribution.” More recently, the advent of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools — which can create humanlike writing, realistic images and other content in response to user prompts — have raised new concerns among industry and government officials.

        June 5, 2023
      
           Fred Pelzman of Weill Cornell Internal Medicine Associates and weekly blogger for MedPage Today, follows what's going on in the world of primary care medicine from the perspective of his own practice.   I don't know about you, but right now I'm worried that there is someone out there figuring out how to make AI make healthcare providers work harder  --  not work better. And most of all, I'm worried that that ""someone"" is not us. I'm worried that there are many forces out there, some of them aligned, some of them working independently, that are taking a look at artificial intelligence and saying, ""This is the answer! This is how we are finally going to fix the healthcare system."" But I'm concerned that it's not us. We've seen this happen before, with seemingly well-intentioned people who feel they know the best way to do things telling those of us on the front lines how to do healthcare. Somebody tries to tell us what medicines we can prescribe, which treatments and procedures will be covered for our patients, how to write a note in the electronic medical record, or what we are mandated to screen for. The Art of Medicine All those years ago, when we learned how to write a progress note in medical school, we were taught by people who were never really worried about creating a billing-compliant document. My greatest mentors were those who were terrific clinicians, brilliant diagnosticians, and caring and compassionate people  --  people who weren't interested in committing fraud but were interested in taking care of patients. They saw this process that we went through  --  the history, the physical exam, and the compilation of data  --  as a work of art. Building on our stored knowledge, collective memories, a knowledge of the literature, and so much more, all of that went into actually taking care of people. It wasn't about just making sure that you had 10 organ systems reviewed, each of them with a large collection of itemized symptoms that were not really relevant to the patient's care on that day. Sure, way back in medical school I remember being taught about what was involved in a ""complete"" review of systems, all the things you needed to go through to make sure you had not missed anything. But after a while, much of this falls by the wayside. The more experienced a clinician gets, the less they are reliant on these obscure and often irrelevant items. The powers-that-be have insisted that we continue to include these, along with so much other ephemera and trivia to plump up our notes and keep someone other than ourselves, our colleagues, and our patients healthy and happy. Someone also decided we need to ask for a pain score at every office visit, screen for depression and suicidality at every office visit, ask about falls at every office visit, and click a bunch of boxes about social determinants of health, when no one has ever really shown that doing all this leads to fixing these problems in any direct way. A Solution That Comes With Problems Now something big and promising and actually very terrifying comes along: the looming promise of artificial intelligence in healthcare. Even as I write this, there are probably meetings taking place, conferences, think tanks, and lots of people coming up with bright ideas about how to use this to get more done in healthcare. But those of us working in the day-to-day world of taking care of patients know that solutions like this, more often than not, create more problems than they solve. If an artificial intelligence system just generates a vast differential diagnosis and pushes an enormous number of suggestions at us for what to do next, we end up being obligated to cover these bases, to order these tests, to go down these misleading paths of our patient's care. Over the past few months, there been a number of well-publicized examples of what I've heard described as a ""hallucitations""  --  the creation of false data to support something that artificial intelligence says is true. There was even that recent case involving a lawsuit against an airline, where the lawyer for the plaintiff presented a written argument to the judge that was filled with false case references, created by the artificial intelligence chatbot, which in fact the lawyer had allegedly asked the system to confirm were true, which it did with conviction. But they weren't. Seeing the Potential As I've written before, I feel that there is truly amazing potential for these kinds of systems to do a lot of rote work and busywork and repetitive tasks to make our lives easier, not harder. And perhaps, as our radiologist colleagues are already doing in some fashion, it can serve as an aid to work alongside us, helping make sure we don't miss things, without overdoing it and creating excessive worry. I can see a future where some intelligent systems like these work as our assistant, helping make sure that tasks get accomplished, that patients get reminded about things they are due for, that appropriate follow-up appointments are made and kept, that data are collected and collated appropriately, perhaps even with some helpful interpretation and suggestions thrown in for good measure. But if we let the pharmaceutical companies, the insurance companies, the hospital systems, the creators of electronic health records and others, do this without the direct hands-on input and guidance of those who are ultimately going to use these tools, we risk plunging yet again into an even deeper morass of stuff that people think is a really good idea but ends up not actually helping anybody. So, I wish that the folks who are working on this, at whatever tech companies out there, would be willing to reach out to primary care doctors, to surgeons, to radiologists, to ophthalmologists, to dermatologists, to every member of the healthcare team, to ask us how we think this stuff might help. Let them show us what it can do, and then let us suggest ways it could help, and let us warn them about what it shouldn't do. If this were to happen, we will be more likely to end up with something that saves money, prevents burnout, and saves lives. As we learned in the first Terminator (1984) movie (and all subsequent ones), we always let things get out of hand. Skynet, the AI system they thought was going to fix everything, begins to learn rapidly, and becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. on August 29, 1997. Who could have ever predicted that this would happen? Amazing to me now how long ago that date looks from where we are now. And how worrisome it is that we still might not have learned anything.

"23","Support our Mission! Human intelligence may be just a brief phase before machines take over. That may answer where the aliens are hiding The Fermi paradox takes its name from a 1950s visit by physicist Enrico Fermi to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. One day, as Fermi was walking to lunch with physicist colleagues Emil Konopinski, Edward Teller and Herbert York, one mentioned a New Yorker cartoon depicting aliens stealing public trash cans from the streets of New York. While dining later, Fermi suddenly returned to the topic of aliens by asking: “Where is everybody?” Whereas not everybody agrees as to what Fermi was precisely questioning, the “paradox” has generally been interpreted as Fermi expressing his surprise over the absence of any signs for the existence of other intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way. Because a simple estimate showed that an advanced civilization could have reached every corner of the galaxy within a time much shorter than the galaxy’s age, the question arose: Why don’t we see them?  Over the years that have passed since Fermi asked his question, dozens of potential solutions to the “paradox” have been suggested. In particular, a few scientists have argued that the absence of alien signals is the result of a “great filter”—an evolutionary bottleneck impenetrable to most life. If true, this great filter is either in our past or in our future. If it’s behind us, then it may have occurred when life spontaneously emerged, for example, or when single-cell organisms transitioned to multicellular ones. Either way, it implies that complex life is rare, and we may even be alone in the Milky Way. If, on the other hand, the great filter is ahead of us, then most advanced civilizations may eventually hit a wall and cease to exist. If so, that too may be humanity’s fate. Instead, we would like to propose a new way of thinking about the Fermi paradox. It stands to reason that there are chemical and metabolic limits to the size and processing power of organic brains. In fact, we may be close to those limits already. But no such limits constrain electronic computers (still less, perhaps, quantum computers). So, by any definition of “thinking,” the capacity and intensity of organic, human-type brains will eventually be utterly swamped by the cerebrations of artificial intelligence (AI). We may be near the end of Darwinian evolution, whereas the evolution of technological intelligent beings is only at its infancy. Few doubt that machines will gradually surpass or enhance more and more of our distinctively human capabilities. The only question is when. Computer scientist Ray Kurzweil and a few other futurists think that AI dominance will arrive in just a few decades. Others envisage centuries. Either way, however, the timescales involved in technological advances span but an instant compared to the evolutionary timescales that have produced humanity. What’s more, the technological timescales are less than a millionth of the vast expanses of cosmic time lying ahead. So, the outcomes of future technological evolution could surpass humans by as much as we intellectually surpass a comb jelly. But what about consciousness? Philosophers and computer scientists debate whether consciousness is a special property associated only with the kind of wet, organic brains possessed by humans, apes and dogs. In other words, might electronic intelligences, even if their capabilities seem superhuman, still lack self-awareness or an inner life? Or perhaps consciousness emerges in any sufficiently complex network? Some say that this question is irrelevant and semantic—like asking whether submarines swim. We don’t think so. The answer crucially affects how we react to the far-future scenario we’ve sketched: If the machines are what philosophers refer to as “zombies,” we would not accord their experiences the same value as ours, and the posthuman future would seem rather bleak. If, on the other hand, they are conscious, we should surely welcome the prospect of their future hegemony. Suppose now that there are indeed many other planets on which life began, and that some or most followed a somewhat similar evolutionary track as Earth. Even then, however, it’s highly unlikely that the key stages in that evolution would be synchronized with those on Earth. If the emergence of intelligence and technology on an exoplanet lags significantly behind what has happened on Earth (either because the planet is younger, or because some “filters” have taken longer to negotiate) then that planet would plainly reveal no evidence of an intelligent species. On the other hand, around a star older than the sun, life could have had a significant head start of a billion years or more. Organic creatures need a planetary surface environment for the chemical reactions leading to the origin of life to take place, but if posthumans make the transition to fully electronic intelligences, they won’t need liquid water or an atmosphere. They may even prefer zero gravity, especially for building massive artifacts. So it may be in deep space, not on a planetary surface, that nonbiological “brains” may develop powers that humans can’t even imagine. The history of human technological civilization may measure only in millennia (at most), and it may be only one or two more centuries before humans are overtaken or transcended by inorganic intelligence, which might then persist, continuing to evolve on a faster-than-Darwinian timescale, for billions of years. That is, organic human-level intelligence may be, generically, just a brief phase, before the machines take over. If alien intelligence has evolved similarly, we’d be most unlikely to catch it in the brief sliver of time when it was still embodied in the organic form. Particularly, were we to detect ET, it would be far more likely to be electronic, where the dominant creatures aren’t flesh and blood—and maybe aren’t even located on planets, but on stations in deep space. The question then becomes whether the fact that electronic civilizations can live for billions of years seriously exacerbates the Fermi paradox. The answer is: not really. While most of us who are puzzled by the Fermi paradox and the absence of alien signs imagine other civilizations as being expansionist and aggressive, this is not necessarily the case. The key point is that whereas Darwinian natural selection has put in some sense at least a premium on survival of the fittest, posthuman evolution, which will not involve natural selection, need not be aggressive or expansionist at all. These electronic progeny of flesh and blood civilizations could last for a billion years—maybe leading quiet, contemplative lives. The focus of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) so far has been on radio or optical signals, but we should be alert also to evidence for non-natural construction projects, such as a “Dyson sphere,” built to harvest a large fraction of stellar power, and even to the possibility of alien artifacts lurking within our solar system. If SETI were to succeed, we think that it would be unlikely that the signal it observes would be a simple, decodable message. It would more likely be a byproduct (or maybe even an accident or malfunction) of some supercomplex machine far beyond our comprehension. Even if messages were transmitted, we may not recognize them as artificial because we may not know how to decode them. A veteran radio engineer familiar only with amplitude-modulation might have a hard time decoding modern wireless communication. Indeed, compression techniques today aim to make signals as close to noise as possible.  So to conclude: conjectures about advanced or intelligent life are on a far shakier ground than those about simple life. We would argue that this suggests three things about the entities that SETI searches could reveal: They will not be organic or biological. They will not remain on the surface of the planet where their biological precursors lived. We will not be able to fathom their motives or intentions.

"24","Taylor Swift performs during ""The Eras Tour"" last month. Technology to mimic the voices of celebrities already exists, and it could affect everyone in the near future. Last week, I used an AI voice generator to create audio of Taylor Swift wishing a friend of mine happy birthday. It didn’t take too long at all. Fueled by rapid advances in artificial intelligence, tools enabling the exact digital replication of voices of celebrities and prominent figures are fairly commonplace online. Known as “deepfakes,” these creations can be practically indistinguishable from an actual person speaking. Deepfakes are widely circulated on certain corners of the internet. In March, people started to create and share TikToks of Presidents Obama, Biden, and Trump playing Minecraft and first-person shooter games together. They’ve collectively received tens of millions of views. These deepfakes are now reaching wider audiences. Recently, Universal Music Studios forced the removal of an (excellent) AI-generated song from Spotify, created by an artist named @ghostwriter, using the voices of Drake and The Weeknd. In fact, “Heart On My Sleeve” was one of many Drake songs I listened to while writing this piece. While these AI generated deepfakes are impressive, they are among the many causes for extreme concern surrounding this emergent technology. Imagine a future where scam callers have the ability to perfectly mimic the voice of a loved one of a target. We aren’t far from that. Already, chatbot products have forever changed the way we access and consume knowledge. Products like ChatGPT can simulate human conversation and have access to the collective knowledge of the internet. Students can feed essay prompts and test questions to the program and get answers that are mostly accurate. It generally scores at the 90th percentile or above on standardized tests, and ""performed at or near the passing threshold for all three exams without any specialized training or reinforcement” on the U.S Medical Licensing Exam. By the way, ChatGPT was only launched about six months ago. Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy has been an early voice of caution on the dangers of artificial intelligence. He has warned of potential job losses and the dangers of more effective misinformation. More importantly, he has spoken of the cost to humanity of outsourcing human judgment, thought and generative creativity to unthinking and unfeeling chatbots. AI evangelists quickly descended upon one of his tweets that communicated the threat of AI in an easily accessible way, nitpicking minor terminological errors instead of responding to the substance of his points. We’ve seen this playbook before. When pressing tech executives on the effects of harmful social media algorithms and content on girls, a question asked by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, “will you commit to ending ‘Finsta’?” went viral. He was referencing ‘secret’ second accounts generally  used by people to share content with close friends, but sometimes used by young children to view and post harmful content without parental oversight. Though he fully understood what a Finsta was, Big Tech allies then used a singular moment to paint the federal government as somehow unqualified to regulate them, though it is certainly within their bounds to do so. The premise that only those who have a deep technical understanding of artificial intelligence can have opinions on its potential impacts is sorely misguided. It would make it so that only the software engineers responsible for creating these products could decide policy on something that will impact every single one of us. I think it’s pretty simple. People should be allowed to debate and discuss regulations around artificial intelligence without being shamed because of a poor turn of phrase, or because they do not fully understand the underlying software. We should have democratically created rules about whether people have the legal right to digitally reproduce your voice. The process to create these rules is going to involve a lot of dated analogies to the Terminator, and perhaps some fundamental misunderstandings about Star Wars. Embrace it, and keep your eye on the ball. I’d rather our elected officials work it out, guided by human morals and logic, rather than outsourcing decisions like these to unthinking and unfeeling machines. In the early days of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg’s motto was “move fast and break things.” I hope Congress adopts that same mentality when it comes to regulating artificial intelligence. They should craft regulations that protect the basic right to our voices and identities, and do whatever it takes to prevent this technology from harming us. We should care a lot less about the economic gains that artificial intelligence could unlock, and a lot more about receiving those benefits on our own terms while retaining oversight of the technology’s growth. We risk repeating Washington’s failure to regulate social media companies. Their inaction, fueled by Big Tech’s intense lobbying efforts against meaningful regulation, has contributed to an unprecedented teen mental health crisis, an era of misinformation, and the amplification of extremist voices. We are now faced with an arguably more significant technological advance. And everyone should be able to talk about it.

"26","June 5, 2023 McMaster’s Task Force on Generative AI in Teaching and Learning has released provisional guidelines for instructors and students ahead of schedule to help instructors plan for the fall term. The guidelines were developed to help instructors and students use the emerging technology to advance teaching and learning. They include information on how to cite the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and examples of rubrics that have been adapted to assess students’ use of AI. This is information that many educators on campus asked for after the announcement of the task force a few weeks ago. “Our goal is to help people understand where the technology is right now, how it may change educational approaches and how instructors can bring it into the classroom to enhance student learning, if appropriate,” said Erin Aspenlieder, associate director, at the MacPherson Institute. The new guidelines have been developed with the intent of being a starting point for instructors to understand the potential uses of generative AI for their teaching and for student learning. Guidance will continue to be updated over the summer as the task force responds to feedback, explores more topics and tracks the evolution of the technology. The task force is also working on resources and materials specifically targeted to students for the fall. Zachary Gan, an undergraduate student in the Arts and Science program and a member of the task force, believes AI could enhance learning in the classroom. “My hope is that instructors remain open to the possibilities this new technology offers,” said Gan. “If teaching practices are modified such that the effective use of these tools is encouraged, generative AI could be a catalyst that transforms the university and traditional pedagogy for the better.” The task force acknowledges that the technology may not be appropriate for every class, or every program and students should assume the use of generative AI is prohibited unless explicitly outlined by the course instructor. Potential policy changes implied by the guidelines will still need to be addressed by relevant governance bodies. “We have learned over the past few years that providing guidance as early as possible helps our teaching and learning community embrace new educational approaches,” said Kim Dej, vice-provost, Teaching and Learning. “If we provide people with a place to start, they might feel more comfortable exploring the opportunities and risks and deciding if it makes sense in their teaching practice.” For more information about generative Artificial Intelligence, details about the task force and to access helpful resources, visit the Generative Artificial Intelligence in Teaching and Learning webpage.

"27","The increasing ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate realistic content, such as deep fakes, has caused concern in Hollywood, and the rise of AI is sparking debate among actors, writers, and studios about their compensation and content creation.
  What we need is a UCC that is acceptable to all sections of society, gender and communities Feminists movements first welcomed the idea of a Uniform Civil Code. But as right-wingers hijacked the proposal, they retracted and called for reforms in personal laws instead The proposed Uniform Civil Code is part of a patriarchal Hindu nationalist agenda to give community land to corporates in the name of women’s rights
 A record of the lives of Kashmiri Pandits in the Valley comprising 15 years’ worth of footage The Christian community feels that a Uniform Civil Code will interfere with its personal laws, especially when it comes to divorce Updated: 05 Jun 2023 8:02 pm The increasing ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate realistic content, such as deep fakes, has caused concern in Hollywood, and the rise of AI is sparking debate among actors, writers, and studios about their compensation and content creation. The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) recently expressed concern about the rise of AI deep fakes in Hollywood, reports Interesting Engineering. The actors union is preparing to negotiate labour contracts with studios, and the use of AI is among the top issues. According to SAG-AFTRA Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the actors' ""digital doubles"" should be controlled to ensure fair compensation when using their personas. Actors and writers in Hollywood are concerned that studios will try to cut costs and increase revenue by using AI to generate new content without the assistance and guidance of production. Moreover, the report said that the celebrities such as Hollywood actors Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves have been the victims of unauthorised deep fakes and hyper-realistic AI-generated videos. These incidents have fuelled actors' growing concern about the unregulated use of AI. Meanwhile, top researchers, experts and CEOs (including Sam Altman of OpenAI) have issued a fresh warning about the existential threat artificial intelligence (AI) poses to humanity. In a 22-word statement, they said that ""Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war."" The statement was published by US-based nonprofit, the Center for AI Safety, and was co-signed by Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis as well as Geoffrey Hinton and Youshua Bengio.

"28","The rapid advancement and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked both excitement and concerns about its potential impact on humanity. Gary Marcus, an expert in AI and the author of “Rebooting AI,” has emerged as a cautious voice, highlighting the need for careful consideration and regulation of AI development. While Marcus acknowledges the potential benefits of AI in various fields, he emphasizes the current lack of readiness and the importance of addressing potential harms and establishing effective governance structures. AI’s Upside and Cautionary Perspective Marcus recognizes the immense potential of yet-to-be-invented AI systems in contributing to areas such as science, medicine, and elder care. He believes that future AI advancements could greatly enhance these fields, benefiting society as a whole. However, he raises concerns about the present state of AI development, suggesting that we are unprepared to fully leverage its potential. Marcus argues that there will be unintended consequences and potential harms along the way, necessitating a proactive approach to regulation. The Need for Serious Regulation and Governance Highlighting the potential risks associated with AI, Marcus emphasizes the importance of developing comprehensive regulation to safeguard against adverse impacts. He asserts that in the short term, we must focus on “upping our game” and establishing effective regulatory frameworks to mitigate potential harm. Marcus advocates for the creation of a national or international agency dedicated to AI governance, a viewpoint he shared during a US Senate hearing. By centralizing AI governance, he argues, we can ensure responsible development and avoid undue influence from corporations. While the potential benefits of AI are vast, Gary Marcus urges caution and the implementation of effective regulation to address the current unpreparedness and potential harms associated with AI development. By focusing on comprehensive regulation and establishing dedicated agencies for AI governance, we can mitigate risks and maximize the positive impact of AI. Marcus’s perspective reminds us of the need for a balanced approach that ensures the well-being of society as a whole, while also fostering innovation and progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Support from OpenAI’s Altman and the Call for Balance Marcus finds support in Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, who recently undertook a European tour advocating for a balanced approach to AI regulation. Altman recognizes the need to strike the right balance between safety and innovation. The growing consensus among experts is that while innovation is crucial, it must be coupled with measures to prevent AI-related risks. Both Marcus and Altman caution against placing excessive power in the hands of corporations, who may prioritize their own interests over those of society.  The Reminder of Corporate Influence In light of recent events, Marcus warns against the undue influence exerted by major corporations involved in AI development. He argues that the interests of these companies may not align with the broader societal well-being. The reminder serves as a call to action to ensure that AI governance is not solely dictated by profit-driven entities. Marcus’s cautionary stance emphasizes the importance of balancing corporate interests with the welfare and safety of individuals and communities. Conclusion While the potential benefits of AI are vast, Gary Marcus urges caution and the implementation of effective regulation to address the current unpreparedness and potential harms associated with AI development. By focusing on comprehensive regulation and establishing dedicated agencies for AI governance, we can mitigate risks and maximize the positive impact of AI. Marcus’s perspective reminds us of the need for a balanced approach that ensures the well-being of society as a whole, while also fostering innovation and progress in the field of artificial intelligence.  comments  AIAI Sage MarcusHuman Extinction Om is a final year Engineering student in Panjab University, Chandigarh.

"29","Cathie Wood is the founder and CEO of Ark Invest, an asset management company focused on disruptive technology stocks, especially those that use artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, Ark has made Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and UiPath (NYSE: PATH) its two largest holdings. They account for 8.2% and 6.1% of its portfolio, respectively, signaling high conviction. AAPL STZ TSLA AMZN Here's what investors should know about these AI growth stocks. Tesla led the auto industry in battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales with 24% market share in the first quarter, while runner-up BYD accounted for 15% of BEV sales. The company also reported the highest operating margin among volume automakers in 2022, an achievement CEO Elon Musk attributes to unparalleled manufacturing technology, and management believes the company can maintain its industry-leading margins in 2023 and beyond. What's behind that confidence? One factor is Tesla's ability to produce battery packs (the most expensive part of an electric car) at a lower cost per kilowatt-hour than its peers. Additionally, the company recently unveiled a new vehicle assembly system that will be implemented at Gigafactory Mexico in late 2024. It promises to cut production costs in half while reducing its factory footprint by 40%. But management believes full self-driving (FSD) software will ultimately be the most important source of profitability. FSD software can be sold at 100% gross profit, according to Musk, and it will power the robotaxi Tesla plans to mass-produce in 2024. Ultimately, FSD software will allow the company to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service, entering a market that Ark Invest says could generate $9 trillion in annual revenue by 2030. Of course, autonomous ride-hailing is still in its infancy, but Tesla has a great shot at becoming an industry leader in the future. Musk says Tesla is ""one of the world's leading AI companies"" due to its expertise in AI software and hardware. Tesla has more autonomous driving data than any other automaker because it has more autopilot-enabled vehicles on the road. That data advantage hints at more advanced FSD software because data is the cornerstone of AI. Additionally, Musk says the in-car hardware that runs the FSD software is the ""most efficient inference computer in the world."" Tesla shares currently trade at 8.6 time sales, a discount to the three-year average of 16 times sales. That creates a reasonable buying opportunity, but only for investors who believe the robotaxi narrative. If Tesla fails to evolve into a software and services company (i.e., FSD software and autonomous ride-hailing services), the stock is wildly overvalued at its current price. UiPath specializes in enterprise automation. Its platform helps businesses discover automation opportunities and build software to automate various tasks and workflows, such as extracting document data, moving files, completing forms, and updating databases. The UiPath platform leans on robotic process automation (RPA) to automate simple tasks, but it also incorporates AI to automate complex tasks. For instance, RPA software can pull data from a structured document (i.e., a document with form fields), but RPA software coupled with AI can pull data from an unstructured document, make sense of that data, then act on it. Industry experts have recognized UiPath as a market leader in several software verticals, including RPA, process mining, and intelligent document processing. UiPath delivered mediocre financial results in the first quarter. Its dollar-based net retention rate dropped 16 percentage points to 122%, but that means the average customer still spent 22% more over the past year despite the uncertain economy. First-quarter revenue increased 18% to $290 million and the company reported $67 million in cash from operations, up from a loss of $53 million in the prior year. Looking ahead, UiPath should be able to accelerate growth when economic conditions improve. Many businesses have cut back on spending for fear of a recession, but IT investments will rebound at some point, and implementing RPA and AI solutions will likely be a top priority when that happens. RPA and AI promise to improve productivity and reduce operating costs, and any upswing in demand should draw more businesses to the UiPath platform. On that note, UiPath estimates its addressable market at $61 billion, meaning the company has hardly scratched the surface of its potential. Shares currently trade at 9.1 times sales, a discount to the two-year average of 17.2 times sales. At that price, investors should consider buying a small position in this growth stock.

"30","The content created by artificial intelligence “must be recognized and clearly marked” — at least, according to Vera Jourová, vice President of the European Commission for Values and Transparency, who calls for a broader persecution of AI media. Jourová voiced the demand for AI-tagged content today during a meeting with the signatories of the controversial EU Code of Practice on Disinformation. Intended to combat disinformation on the Internet, the Code of Practice, which includes “44 commitments and 128 concrete measures,” was completed in June 2022 by 44 signatory organizations. Among the latter are Adobe, Clubhouse, Twitch, TikTok, Google, Meta, Kinzen (which Spotify, a dedicated EU lobbyist, acquired in October 2022) and many relatively little—known players. Each of the companies and organizations that added their name to the Rulebook chose and agreed to various “obligations” (the main provisions of which are set out in a voluminous legal text), allegedly intended to prevent the spread of disinformation. And although the detailed Code of Practice contains the only commitment related to artificial intelligence, it goes without saying that the reach and prevalence of this technology has expanded dramatically over the past year. Consequently, Jourová, on the eve of today’s meeting, expressed her opinion that the Code of Practice “should also begin to eliminate new threats, such as [the] misuse of generative AI.” In accordance with Jourová’s remark, she stressed in her tweet this morning that the “main homework” of the signatories includes “eliminating the risks associated with AI.” When it comes to generative AI “like ChatGPT” — whose parent company may leave the EU altogether, as MEPs continue to form a long “AI Law” — a government official said that “these services cannot be used by attackers to create disinformation. ” and said that “such content should be recognized and clearly marked for users.” “Image generators can create authentic images of events that never happened,” Jourová said during a brief speech. “Voice generation software can simulate a human voice based on a sample of a few seconds. New technologies are also creating new challenges to combat disinformation. “Signatories who have services capable of spreading disinformation created by AI should, in turn, implement technology to recognize such content and clearly label it for users,” continued the 58—year-old man, who also touched on the rapidly approaching implementation. The Law on Digital Services. “I have said many times that our main task is to protect freedom of speech. But when it comes to AI production, I don’t see the right of machines to free speech.” Despite the fact that it does not fall into the category of “disinformation”, all types of music (including both authorized and unauthorized releases) are subject to a regulatory requirement requiring the identification of media files created in whole or in part by AI. Despite the relatively limited scope of the Set of Rules on Disinformation, time will tell whether a possible rule will be included in the aforementioned AI Law, another preliminary vote on which is scheduled for the end of this month. Meanwhile, as legislation continues to take shape, many artists and professionals are speaking out against the alleged traps of artificial intelligence, whose influence on music has prompted some financial experts to downgrade Warner Music Group shares.

"31","India's First International News Journal Gates concluded his lengthy speech on this new technology by saying, “As we create robots powered by generative AI, we just have to make sure they don’t get Alzheimer’s disease.” Dementia, hallucinations and Alzheimer’s While everyone thought Gates’ use of the term “Alzheimer’s” was just a joke, it later turned out that the Microsoft founder wasn’t kidding, and the programs and robots that work with generative artificial intelligence can develop Alzheimer’s disease, dementia and hallucinations, and this case is not the result of analysis, but it has already happened with the ChatGPT application. OpenAI, which raced to catch up last week, announced that it would tackle AI hallucinations, taking a new approach to training language models. Insanity, or AI hallucinations, occurs when robots such as ChatGPT, Bard, or other similar programs fabricate events that are not real and insist that they are indisputable facts.These hallucinations are a serious dilemma, especially if they are approved by a human. Christophe Zogby, founder and CEO of technology company Zaka, said in an interview with Sky News Arabia that the story began when a lawyer in the United States used the ChatGPT program to help him convict an airline. and compel him to compensate a passenger who suffered an injury caused by the food cart. On the plane, where the lawyer asked ChatGPT to find case law where airlines had been convicted of similar incidents, and indeed the program provided him with 6 prior related cases, so it became later clear to the court judge that the aforementioned case law does not actually exist. Al-Zoghbi adds that what happened prompted the US attorney to admit that he used ChatGPT to complete his legal research, indicating that the program assured him that the information was correct and appropriate for his request, refusing to give him the source and the legal reference to because what happened indicates that ChatGPT and all similar programs can be infected with Alzheimer’s disease. According to Zogby, ChatGPT is based on a language model, trained to read a lot of text, to synthesize integrated text, because this application is not aimed at finding correct and accurate information, but rather at writing convincing text as it was formed, and he doesn’t care whether this information is correct, so what is important to him is that his position in the sentence is appropriate, and so he can invent names and events as long as ‘they are consistent with his text, and he insists they are true. Zogby considers what is happening to be dangerous, because people are using generative artificial intelligence software, and using it without verifying the accuracy of the information he has given them, so they receive a text that contains a lot of incorrect information, and therefore the advice that can be given here is not to use these programs when searching for specific information, but rather to resort to the famous search engine Google, which provides the answer attached to the link that l user can verify its authenticity. Will this problem finally be solved? أو غيره من البرامج المماثلة بالخرف أو ا 100 لهلوسة، قد لا يتم حلها بنسبة 100 التحقق من القصة أو الواقعة، فإننا قد نصل الى مرحلة تقل فيها الهلوسة، وهذا الأمر لن يحصل في The near future. For his part, Karen Abbas, a digital marketer, said in an interview with “Sky News Arabia Economy” that the reason for describing “Alzheimer’s”, “dementia” or “hallucinations” and not saying that he is “lying ” is ChatGPT or other artificial intelligence programs. This is because the program doesn’t realize it’s lying, but rather, in a moment of “uncertainty”, it analyzes the data it has, in a way it deems correct, just like a person who suffers from dementia, Alzheimer’s disease or hallucinations, where they believe that what they say is 100% true. Therefore, AI bots should not be viewed as a reasonable person who has answers to every question we might need. Abbas also confirmed that with the advancement of time and the development of technology, the percentage of dementia in artificial intelligence programs will decrease in severity, but it is difficult to end it completely, and therefore it is very important for the user to ensure the validity and accuracy of the information he obtains through these programs.

															   Date  Catrin Hinkel, CEO of Microsoft Switzerland, is convinced that artificial intelligence (AI) is the next big step in how we interact with IT. However, this new technology will be a kind of“co-pilot” and will not replace human intelligence, she tells SWI swissinfo.ch at Microsoft's headquarters in Zurich.   SWI swissinfo.ch: You arrived in Zurich from your native Germany in 2021 to head Microsoft's Swiss subsidiary. What surprised you most?   Catrin Hinkel: I was very impressed by the level of innovation and creativity in Switzerland and at Microsoft. The Swiss people have a long history of innovation and the team at Microsoft Switzerland is passionate about creating new and innovative solutions. I was also amazed by the strong cooperation between Microsoft and its partners in Switzerland. Catrin Hinkel was born in Germany in 1969. After completing bilingual business studies at the University of Reutlingen in 1992, she worked for the global consulting firm Accenture. There she held a number of leadership roles, including that of Senior Managing Director for Cloud First Strategy and Consulting in Europe. She has been the CEO of Microsoft Switzerland since May 2021.   SWI: Microsoft employs over 1,000 people in Switzerland. What are the subsidiary's main tasks?   C.H.: As the CEO of Microsoft Switzerland, I'm responsible for the 600-strong“Swiss team”, which is in charge of marketing and sales in Switzerland. We work closely with our customers to support them in their digital journeys. In addition, Microsoft employs a further 400 people in Switzerland who are part of the“international team”.   SWI: What is the role of Microsoft's“international team” in Switzerland?   C.H.: The members of this team are attached to the various technology units in the Microsoft group and contribute to the development of new products at the international level. Both the Swiss team and Swiss customers benefit from the expertise of this international team, particularly in the fields of mixed and augmented reality.      SWI: Some companies such as Google, Amazon, Twitter and Microsoft have recently cut their workforce worldwide. What about Microsoft in Switzerland?   C.H.: We're not able to provide detailed figures. However, as a company operating in highly competitive and dynamic technology markets, we're obliged to adapt flexibly in order to meet our customers' requirements. This is the norm in our market. We're therefore taking on new recruits in areas where we're expanding and where we see a future; meanwhile, in sectors where our growth is weaker, we're positioning ourselves accordingly so as to remain agile.   SWI: To what extent are you affected by the shortage of IT specialists in Switzerland?   C.H.: The shortage of specialists is a serious problem, both in Switzerland and abroad, not just for Microsoft but also for our customers and our partners. To help solve the problem, we launched the“Skills for Switzerland” initiative in 2020. This has enabled us to boost the digital skills of more than 630,000 people in Switzerland. Organisations such as the human resource company Adecco, based in Zurich, and the CyberPeace Institute, in Geneva, are also taking part in this scheme. What's more, we are working on other projects with the association digitalswitzerland and retailer Migros. More 
switzerland is an attractive place to work and the country needs specialists. but work permits can be hard to come by.    SWI: The cloud market is booming and, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC), should exceed $11 billion (CHF10 billion) in Switzerland by 2026. How do you explain this growth?   C.H.: Thanks to the cloud services of a company like Microsoft, our customers can outsource their data processing and benefit from huge economies of scale and skills. In concrete terms, thanks to the cloud, a very large number of Swiss companies of all sizes have access to new technologies such as artificial intelligence at competitive costs. This means that companies can innovate as they wish; so, ultimately, it can be said that the cloud fuels innovation.   SWI: The fact that your client companies' data is sometimes stored abroad is a source of concern.   C.H.: Microsoft is a global company that serves both a local and international clientele, so we strive to provide our customers with the most appropriate solutions. In Switzerland, thanks to the presence of our four data centres, we can offer sound local solutions. This local offering has also enabled us to win the trust of Swiss companies that are subject to stringent local requirements. I'm thinking, for example, of banks of all sizes, which are highly regulated and supervised by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).   SWI: Nevertheless, some Swiss members of parliament are concerned that you may have access to sensitive customer data. How do you assuage their fears?   C.H.: With cloud services, we provide our customers with technological platforms. We're not at all interested in the data on these platforms. It's totally out of the question for us to use this data or pass it on to other companies. What's more, on our platforms, our customers' data is protected by encryption. What interests us, ultimately, is the democratisation of new technologies.   SWI: What's your view on technological developments such as blockchain, the metaverse and AI?   
sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox.  C.H.: When used properly, technology can make people's lives simpler, more efficient and more enjoyable, especially when it comes to carrying out routine tasks. Nevertheless, technology will always remain an aid, a kind of co-pilot, and will never replace real men and women. As for AI, it's the defining technology of our time. It's also the next big step forward in the way we interact with IT. In a world that is increasingly complex economically, AI has the power to revolutionise many types of jobs.   SWI: What are your main AI applications?   C.H.: Our investment in AI spans our entire business, from Teams and Outlook to Bing and Xbox. We're already seeing considerable interest from our customers in Switzerland and are actively working on“value cases”. For example, our Copilot application can be used to quickly extract basic data from a 300-page annual report.   SWI: AI raises numerous ethical issues. Several countries are enacting laws to regulate its use.   C.H.: This is precisely why in 2018 Microsoft defined a series of ethical principles applicable to all our uses of AI. For instance, we exclude all bias based on race. We also rule out any applications that are not yet completely reliable and which, in case of malfunction, could harm individuals; I'm thinking of facial recognition, for example.

                    danah boyd I’ve spent much of my career arguing that the main function of higher education is not to teach useful skills (or even useless skills), but to certify students’ employability. By and large, the reason our customers are on campus is to credibly show, or “signal,” their intelligence, work ethic, and conformity. While we like to picture education as job training, it is largely a passport to the real training that happens on the job. How will AI change our system? To start, we should bet against any major disruption. Students will not abandon traditional colleges en masse for virtual AI training centers. And since most majors are already barely job-related, students will generally stick with their existing majors. What will change for students is workload and evaluation. Professors are used to assigning papers and projects to be done outside of class. Using AI to cheat on such work will soon be child’s play. Harsh punishments for cheating might preserve the status quo, but colleges generally give cheaters a slap on the wrist, and that won’t change. Unmonitored academic work will become optional, or a farce. The only thing that will really matter will be exams. And unless the exams are in-person, they’ll be a farce, too. I’m known for giving difficult tests, yet GPT-4 already gets A’s on them. AI will also change the labor market itself. As a general rule, new technologies take decades to realize their full potential. The first true trans-Atlantic phone call wasn’t placed until 1956, almost 80 years after the invention of the phone. E-commerce was technically feasible in the mid-’90s, but local malls still endure. We should expect AI to slowly disrupt a wide range of industries, including computer science itself. This will, in turn, slowly alter students’ career aspirations. But as an economist, I scoff at the idea that AI will permanently disemploy the population. Human wants are unlimited, and human skills are flexible. Agriculture was humanity’s dominant industry for millennia; when technology virtually wiped out agricultural jobs, we still found plenty of new work to do instead. I do not, however, scoff at the idea that AI could drastically reduce employment in computer science over the next two decades. Humans will specialize in whatever AI does worst. What about us humble professors? Those of us with tenure have nothing to worry about. Taxpayers and donors will keep funding us no matter how useless we become. If you don’t have tenure, students will keep coming and your job will go on — unless you’re at a mediocre private college with a small endowment. Except for cutting-edge empiricists, however, AI will make research even more of a scam than it already is. Consider the ease with which the Sokal Hoax or the “grievance studies” hoax were perpetrated. AI will be able to do the same on an industrial scale. If you want a picture of the academic future, imagine a bot writing a thousand turgid pages a second about “neoliberalism,” “patriarchy,” and “anti-racism” — forever. Outside of the most empirical subjects, the determinants of academic status will be uniquely human — networking and sheer charisma — making it a great time to reread Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People. Bryan Caplan is a professor of economics at George Mason University. Illustrations by Harry Campbell for the Chronicle For decades, higher education’s solution to burgeoning enrollment and increased demand for student services stayed the same: hire more people. As Frank Yeary, a former vice chancellor at the University of California at Berkeley, told me in 2012, “We threw people at problems, rather than technology.” But now, with enrollment declines exacerbating financial worries and more than half of college staff members considering leaving their jobs in the next year, colleges need to learn how to rely on technology. While much of the discussion has focused on what generative AI means for teaching, learning, and research, its immediate impact will likely be felt on functions outside of the academic core. Let’s start where turnover rates among staff are the worst: admissions. Most colleges accept most students who apply using a selection process that is routine and predictable. AI could be trained to make decisions about who gets accepted — or at least make the first cut of applicants. Yes, colleges will still need humans for recruiting, but even there, AI is increasingly capable of finding and marketing to prospective students. At selective institutions, which have seen their application totals skyrocket in recent years, AI can at the very least review the quantitative elements of admissions, such as high-school courses and grades, and reduce the number of files that need a human touch. Colleges have already started to deploy AI-powered chatbots to answer students’ everyday questions and help them show up for classes. Saint Louis University, for instance, added smart devices to dorm rooms that have been programmed to answer more than 600 questions from “What time does the library close tonight?” to “Where is the registrar’s office?” The next iteration of these chatbots is to personalize them to answer questions that are specific to a student (“When is my history exam?”) and bring them into the classroom. When Georgia State University added a chatbot to an intro government course to nudge students on studying and assignments, researchers found significant improvements in student performance. In particular, first-generation students who got reminders took the recommended actions, such as completing assignments, at higher rates. With campuses now awash in data about their students and operations, AI can be used to tackle administrative functions from financial aid to the registrar’s office. At Arizona State University, AI is rewriting course descriptions to make them more informative for prospective students and improve search performance on the web. So far, however, most of the uses of AI on the administrative side are about making operations more efficient or improving the student experience, not reducing the work force. Officials at companies that provide AI services to higher education tell me that colleges are sometimes reluctant to buy the products because they don’t want them to be seen as replacing people. But until campuses use AI in that way — to take over for people in jobs that involve processing information or doing repeatable tasks — then we won’t reverse or slow down the upward-cost trajectory of higher education, where most tuition dollars are now spent on functions outside of the classroom. Jeffrey J. Selingo, an author and former editor of The Chronicle of Higher Education, is a professor of practice at Arizona State University. Most of today’s discussions about the impact of AI on education focus on perceived problems in teaching and evaluating students. Yet there is a far larger effect of AI’s advance: Many types of work will be taken over by machines, and jobs will vanish. This change is typically seen as a cause for gloom. I suggest we see it as an opportunity to revitalize education by replacing unsatisfying work with meaningful labor.
 Education aims to help young people develop as individuals and as citizens, not simply to become cogs in the machinery of national production. If the cogs can be made by ingenious AI systems, so much the better. The previously employed people can be liberated to do something else. Not necessarily to expand productivity, but to advance educational goals that we neglect. Let’s do that by vastly increasing the number of people who educate the young and raising the pay of those who undertake these important tasks — the “main enterprise of the world,” as Emerson once characterized it. Let’s remove the stigma from service work and appreciate its enormous worth. Let’s train more adults and put more of them in the classroom. Let’s give them the opportunity to recognize each child’s individuality, to help young people understand themselves, overcome the difficulties they encounter, and work with one another. During the past few decades, education in the affluent world has been largely dominated by a crude economic imperative. But children are not vehicles to be sent into some global demolition derby. If students are to have fulfilled lives, in which they can take on civic responsibilities and build healthy communities, they need far more than a collection of technical skills based on contemporary understandings of what ventures may equip a nation with some competitive edge. Giving teachers the respect and social standing they deserve, and recruiting a larger group of adults to join them and assist them in the classroom, would advance the goals serious thinkers about education, from Plato to the present, have always recognized. AI’s displacement of labor can be an opportunity for liberation. Philip Kitcher is a professor emeritus of philosophy at Columbia University. Hollis Robbins is dean of humanities at the University of Utah. Our understanding of AI is strongly shaped by the recent success of ChatGPT and other chatbots. They mold a language model (which in principle could imitate any number of genres) into the familiar form of a question-answering utility like Siri or Google Search: ask a short question and get a short answer. An all-purpose question answerer is certainly easy to use. But professors want students to acquire habits of skeptical dialogic inquiry, not a habit of relying on an oracle. In an academic context, we should approach language models as engines for provisional reasoning — “calculators for words,” as British programmer Simon Willison calls them. Instead of assuming that the model already has an answer to every question in memory, this approach provides, in the prompt, any special assumptions or background knowledge the model will be expected to use. A student might hand in a model of a scientific article and ask for explication of a difficult passage. A researcher might provide a thousand documents, serially, and ask the model to answer the same questions about each one. A writer might provide a draft essay and ask for advice about structure. Used in this epistemically cautious way, AI has a valid, important role to play in education. But if a cautious approach to AI is advisable, I don’t mean to imply that it is easy to achieve. Students will be tempted instead to rely on models as oracles. And it will take work to define an appropriate level of caution. What counts as an assumption that needs to be offered provisionally in a prompt — or as linguistic common sense that can be hard-coded in a model? The question is contestable. In fact, we will need to teach students to contest it. Students in every major will need to know how to challenge or defend the appropriateness of a given model for a given question. To teach them how to do that, we don’t need to hastily construct a new field called “critical AI studies.” The intellectual resources students need are already present in the history and philosophy of science courses, along with the disciplines of statistics and machine learning themselves, which are deeply self-conscious about their own epistemic procedures. Readings from all of those fields belong in a 21st-century core curriculum. Ted Underwood is a professor of information science and English at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. AI is part of a larger phenomenon that has shaped knowledge production around the world — an enormous democratization of what is known as well as what is knowable. Indeed, almost all of the macro-trends shaping higher education come down to the increasing availability of information. At times, it seems, people want to credit the internet for this revolution. However, it’s not Wikipedia that has made the biggest change to the availability of information, or what counts as knowledge. Look at our own institutions. Since the ‘60s, colleges have been home to new fields of discovery that have not only expanded the landscape of knowledge, but have helped expand the collective sense of what it means to be human. Women’s, gender, Africana, Asian American, Chicano/a and Latino/a studies are a few examples. We also have fields that have stretched the limit of how we know (computer science, neuroscience, or cognitive science), what we know (materials science or string theory), and how we use it (environmental engineering, data science, and nanotechnology), just to name a few. It is commonplace to lament that colleges are great at adding new things but not so great at ending them. But that isn’t something to lament. We are here to add to knowledge, not erase it or pretend it never happened. This means that the frontiers of knowledge aren’t here to be shunned by higher education. They are here to be pressed. If AI is an outgrowth of the human drive to know, which it is, it can emerge as a positive contributor not just to what humans know, but how. My conviction here emerges in part from my own research in the neuroscience of aesthetics, which has led me to believe that the probabilistic nature of human learning — the very principle that undergirds modern AI — is intricately connected to something that seems to hit at the core of who we are as humans: our ability to experience beauty. Simply put, beauty emerges with certain kinds of learning because we can experience pleasure when the predictions we make about the world are verified — when we predict what happens next, or what goes together, and we are right. We also experience pleasure when we learn something new, especially when what we learn provides insight into something that had previously been ambiguous, uncertain, or confusing. More than this, aesthetic pleasure can enhance learning by orienting us toward objects and experiences that may afford the biggest learning gains. Nothing ChatGPT does will take away the pleasures of learning. More profoundly, it seems clear that the active part of learning is immensely important. Learning requires more than synthesis of information, for it is in the testing of knowledge that we make the biggest gains in understanding. This means that it is how we put our knowledge to work that matters. It also means that learning is a social undertaking, in which we discuss, dispute, verify, reject, modify, and extend what we (think we) know to other people and the world around us. These are fundamentally human endeavors. What differentiates humans from AI, in part, comes down to that: The pleasures of learning lead us toward creative possibilities, as well as toward active experimentation. For now, humans do that, and they do it pretty well. And I would advise that humans limit AI action — the ability to directly influence the world around us by altering or manipulating it – because it is in action that what humans value most really lies. It is in not just what we do, but in the effects of what we do in the world. It is in ethics that humanity finds itself and determines its own meaning. The hope for humanity remains where it always was: with us and us alone. G. Gabrielle Starr is president of Pomona College. The announcement of ChatGPT and subsequent wave of emotional energy, both positive and negative, have triggered a powerful case of déjà vu among scholars who study the socioeconomic effects of new technologies. After all, it was less than a decade ago that books like Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee’s The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (2014) and Martin Ford’s Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future (2015) were predicting rapidly increasing productivity as a result of artificial intelligence and robotics. Those predictions came to naught. Productivity has remained low throughout the last decade, and in some quarters in the United States was even negative. Historians of computing will tell you about similar bubbles around AI in the 1960s and 1980s, which, when the promises of the technologies failed to arrive, were followed by “AI winters,” periods when funding for research into artificial intelligence all but dried up. Yet we still see hysterically positive and negative appraisals of ChatGPT. Sam Altman, chief executive of ChatGPT’s maker, OpenAI, told reporters that AI would “eclipse the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution, the internet revolution all put together.” Meanwhile, the Future of Life Institute published an open letter calling for a six-month ban on training AI systems more powerful than GPT-4 because they would threaten humanity. At the time of this writing, nearly 30,000 people have signed the letter. Why, after so many technology bubbles that have ended in pops and deflations, do these same histrionic scripts continue to play out? Surely, many factors play a role in creating bubbles, including weakly reported media hype and irresponsible social-media influencers. But one factor that colleges and universities have some control over is that, to date, we simply do not teach how to think about the social and economic impacts of new technologies. Such an education would teach students about how technology bubbles are rooted in the power of narratives about how new systems will develop and influence society, as the business-school professors Brent Goldfarb and David A. Kirsch discuss in their 2019 book, Bubbles and Crashes: The Boom and Bust of Technological Innovation. The first stories to emerge around new technologies typically offer hyperbolic assessments of powers, promises, and threats. And they are almost always wrong. Lee Vinsel is a professor of science, technology, and society at Virginia Tech. Let’s assume that AI will transform every industry and everyone — changing how we live, shaping what we believe in, displacing jobs. And disrupting education. Well, after IBM’s Deep Blue beat the world champion, we still play chess. After calculators, children are still taught how to add. Human beings learn and do things not just to survive, but also for fun, or as a training of our mind. That doesn’t mean we don’t adapt. Once calculators became prevalent, elementary schools pivoted to translating real-world problems into math formulations rather than training for arithmetic speed. Once online search became widely available, colleges taught students how to properly cite online sources. Some have explored banning AI in education. That would be hard to enforce; it’s also unhealthy, as students will need to function in an AI-infused workplace upon graduation. Pausing AI research would be even less practical, not least because AI is not a well-defined, clearly demarcated area. Colleges and companies around the world would have to stop any research that involves math. One of my Ph.D. advisers, Professor Tom Cover, did groundbreaking work in the 1960s on neural networks and statistics, not realizing they would later become useful in what others call AI. As it stands today, AI is good at following rules, not breaking rules; reinforcing patterns, not creating patterns; mimicking what’s given, not imagining beyond their combinations. Even individualization algorithms, ironically, work by first grouping many individuals into a small number of “similarity classes.” We need to skeptically scrutinize the dependence of AI engines’ output on their input. Data tends to feed on itself, and machines often give people what we want to see. We need to preserve dissent even when it’s inconvenient, and avoid philosopher-kings dressed in AI. We need entrepreneurs to invent competing AI systems and maximize choices outside the big-tech oligopoly. Some of them will invent ways to break big data. Like many technologies, AI is born neutral but can be abused, especially in the name of the “collective good.” The gravest risk of AI is its abuse by authoritarian regimes. My worst fear is that AI will shrink individual freedom. Our best hope for AI is that it advances individual freedom. To ensure that it does, we need verifiable principles. We need to preserve the capacity to opt out, to the maximum degree possible. We need to ensure transparency in how we deploy AI. And we need to ensure that individuals have the ability to litigate when their rights are violated in an independent judicial system under the rule of law. Let us preserve individuals’ rights. Let our students sharpen the ability to doubt, debate, and dissent. Mung Chiang is president of Purdue University. This essay is adapted from his 2023 commencement address at Purdue. The landscape of college admissions is bifurcated. The “haves” — colleges with big national reputations and large endowments — tout escalating numbers of applicants and precipitous drops in admit rates. Conversely, at the “have-nots,” discount rates rise, the threat of layoffs and furloughs becomes more common, and the pressure to reverse fiscal shortfalls expands with each cycle. Behind the numbers are people: admissions deans, directors, and their staffs. And while their day-to-day pressures are sharply different, their posture is the same: broken. Two recent Chronicle articles captured the causes: low salaries, stunted career progress, and unreasonable work-life balance, to name a few.
Answers, however, have been in short supply. While AI is not a panacea, it is a significant part of the solution. Colleges that invest in and rigorously train AI to generate automated, high-quality responses to student inquiries will free admission staff members from perfunctory, time-consuming, and low-return work, allowing them to focus instead on higher level, mission-aligned efforts. That shift will increase professional-growth opportunities and network building, both of which will foster job satisfaction and retention. Admissions officers at the “haves” are overwhelmed by the volume of applicants and the unforgiving calendar, which requires receipt, review, and return of decisions in a matter of weeks or months. Rolling out AI software that can map prior admissions decisions, assess the performance of current students with similar profiles, and make preliminary recommendations will allow admissions officers to spend far less time reading essays and combing through student activities. Monotony leads to burn-out. And nothing says monotony like “reading season” (the endless hours, days, and weeks admissions officers spend poring over applications). The efficiency and acceleration of AI models are the interrupter necessary to allow admissions officers to look less at the trees (individual applications) and more at the forest (institutional goals, mission, and priorities). Many view AI as a threat. But when it comes to college admissions, I have no doubt that AI will be an agent of redemption. Rick Clark is assistant vice provost and executive director of undergraduate admissions at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The current furor about AI is too little and too late, and has turned into the sort of hysteria that has accompanied most if not all technological revolutions in the West. The printing press inspired fear and panic among the minuscule portion of the European population that had been literate. Printing led to mass literacy, which then was held responsible for the Terror during the French Revolution; pessimism surrounded mass print journalism and fiction. Balzac and Flaubert reveled in depicting the corrosive influence cheap romance novels and newspapers had on their readers. The current debate over AI is vaguely reminiscent of other past controversies about the influence of recording (gramophone and radio), and later in the 20th century, film and television. We are still struggling with understanding the impact of the computer, the internet, and the smartphone. But we should remember, as a cautionary tale, that the railroad was once considered deleterious to health and an engine of cultural decline. Yet we ought not underestimate the potential of AI. It must be regulated. But its transformational power and progress cannot and will not be stopped. Nor should it be. After taking the proverbial deep breath, we must approach the future with reasoned optimism. AI will certainly force us to concentrate on those talents and skills that will remain uniquely human. For those concerned about students’ abusing the power of ChatGPT, we just have to take the time and make sure we know our students and have worked with them closely enough to both inspire them to do their own work and take pride in work that is their own. We will have to become smarter in detecting manipulation and the deceptive simulation of reality. We have to find the legal and political means to control the vast private corporations that will own this technology. AI, like nuclear weapons, will remind us that the idea that we can live in modernity without government is an illusion. Most of all, we need to focus on the benefits of AI, particularly in medicine and science. The most significant challenge to colleges will be how to prepare students for a world dominated by AI. How can we help them find joy, meaning, and value, and also gainful employment, when machines will do so much of what we do now? AI will eliminate far more employment than the automatic elevator, E-ZPass, and computer-controlled manufacturing already have. Work, employment, and compensation will have to be redefined, but in a more systematic manner than after the agricultural and industrial revolutions. Without that effort, the ideals of freedom, individuality, and the protection of civil liberties will be at risk. It is only in the cultivation of human experience — our capacity to think, to link the mind with the heart in writing, imagining, and creating — that we will remain free in an AI-dominated universe. Our affections, our desire to interact with one another — to dream, alone and with others — cannot be supplanted. The promise of those experiences lies squarely in the university, but only if it is prepared to return to its proper human scale in teaching and research, and to abandon its corporate character and outdated concepts of segmented academic professionalism, particularly in the disciplines most needed for creating a better world in the age of AI, those of the arts and humanities. Leon Botstein is president of Bard College. When I began putting together my “State of the Campus” presentation to the University Senate in late February, I workshopped the introduction with not only staff members in the president’s office and our Office of Marketing and Communications, but also with one of the newest arrivals to higher education: ChatGPT. I didn’t do this as a PR stunt, or to demonstrate how new artificial-intelligence systems will uproot and replace traditional learning — or university faculty and staff. I did it to show that ChatGPT, and whatever comes to compete with it or take it to the next level, is not something we need to fear. Every generation of students comes of age with new technology. From the calculator and the personal laptop to smartphones to Zoom, each has been initially met with angst about the disruption to traditional teaching. We fear foundational knowledge will be replaced by robotic inputs and outputs, or that personal interactions unmediated by screens will be eliminated. And so the new technology can seem an obstacle to the parts of the educational experience we love the most — the look when a student first grasps a difficult concept, the spark from an original idea during a brainstorming session, the give-and-take of a classroom debate. But higher ed has a long history of adapting to new events, needs, and technologies: Like the calculator, the personal laptop, smartphones, and Zoom, AI may soon become integral to our enterprise. We must, of course, confront the technology’s capability to increase plagiarism, the spread of misinformation, and confusion over intellectual-property rights, but the positive potential of AI deserves just as much of higher education’s attention as its pitfalls do. If we are to solve the grand challenges of our time, from climate change and gun violence to pandemics and food, water and energy security, we will need to use every tool we have. And we will also need to maintain the optimistic drive to discover what has made us capable of extraordinary feats of intellectual achievement, from vaccines and the moon landing to the early stages of quantum computing. The leaders of Bell Laboratories, one of the most prolific and revolutionary research groups in human history, were fond of saying that while there are plenty of good ideas out there, the more important search was for good problems to solve. What might artificial intelligence mean for our society? That’s a good problem to solve. Let’s get to work. Darryll J. Pines is president of the University of Maryland at College Park, where he is also a professor of aerospace engineering. I cannot seem to escape debates about how AI will change everything. They make me want to crawl into a cave. I nod along as my peers blast students for cheating with ChatGPT — then rave about how Bing Chat’s search function is a more effective research assistant than most students. The contradictions that surround new AI chatbots are fascinating, but the cacophonous polarities are excruciating, and obscure as much as they illuminate.  Technology mirrors and magnifies the good, the bad, and the ugly. But the technology itself is rarely the story. If we care about higher ed, the real question isn't: What will AI do to higher ed? Instead, we should ask: What can the hype and moral panic around AI teach us about higher ed? After a long history of reinforcing inequities and upholding a culture of white supremacy, parts of higher education have spent the last couple of decades reckoning with its history and reimagining its future. Unfortunately, this reckoning has coincided with a decline in government support for both research and education, a drastic increase in the cost for students, and an increase in public skepticism about the value of the project. In short, we find ourselves in the center of a political and economic maelstrom. We're anxious about what AI will do to higher ed because we're anxious about the future of higher ed. But let's not allow AI to distract us from the questions that should animate us: What is the role of higher education in today’s world? What societal project does higher education serve? And is this project viable in a society configured by late-stage capitalism? These are hard questions. AI will not solve any of them. danah boyd is a partner researcher at Microsoft and a visiting professor at Georgetown University.",0.342388153076172,0.312580287456512,0.345031589269638

"37","Architect Ibrahim Mohamed Al-Jaidah, Director General of the Arab Office for Engineering Affairs, stressed the necessity of introducing artificial intelligence in real estate planning and design, due to the great privileges and facilities that this field provides in this field.In exclusive statements to The Arab Weekly on the sidelines of his participation in the first Qatar Real Estate Forum, he said that artificial intelligence reduces more than 95% of the time required in the process of preparing real estate designs and maps, in addition to providing many of the expenses needed by the authorities in the process of studying, designing or choosing. A site for a real estate building.He explained that the traditional process needs more than 6 months to study the selection of the appropriate site according to the population, infrastructure and needs of the region, while these tasks can be accomplished by artificial intelligence in only half an hour, as the artificial intelligence can start the process of analyzing and conducting a study on the site. Specific and give the result in a very short period, and that includes the needs of the region, for example, showing some sites where the sidewalk is used as a car park, and here it shows you the need for car parks, as well as showing the real estate blocks, energy uses, and others. It gives good results in a short period and helps to make the right decision and the appropriate design for the property to be built or invested in. He pointed out that artificial intelligence technologies provide many possibilities such as generative design and genetic algorithms, and huge potential for architects and real estate developers, as it helps them to provide wonderful and advanced architectural solutions in a record time that cannot be achieved by traditional methods. This technology can analyze massive amounts of data to create optimal designs.He explained that this technology provides many opportunities to develop unique and innovative architectural concepts, and to improve design quality and sustainability. Jaidah confirmed that AI-supported design is gaining popularity among international real estate development companies, as it provides the possibility of accelerating the design process, reducing risks, and making accurate and quick investment decisions. AI-assisted design also helps real estate developers find optimal locations for construction projects and bring real estate designs into compliance with local regulations. - A word from our sponsors - This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

"38","Bangor Daily News 
					Maine news, sports, politics, election results, and obituaries				 The BDN Opinion section operates independently and does not set newsroom policies or contribute to reporting or editing articles elsewhere in the newspaper or on bangordailynews.com. “Sometimes I think it’s as if aliens have landed and people haven’t realized because they speak very good English,” said Geoffrey Hinton, the “godfather of AI” (artificial intelligence), who resigned from Google and now fears his godchildren will become “things more intelligent than us, taking control.” And 1,100 people in the business, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, cognitive scientist Gary Marcus and engineers at Amazon, DeepMind, Google, Meta and Microsoft, signed an open letter in March calling for a six-month time-out in the development of the most powerful AI systems (anything “more powerful than GPT-4”). There’s a media feeding frenzy about AI at the moment, and every working journalist is required to have an opinion on it. I turned to the task with some reluctance, as you can tell from the title I put on the piece. My original article said they really should put the brakes on this experiment for a while, but I didn’t declare an emergency. We’ve been hearing warnings about AI taking over since the first “Terminator” movie 39 years ago, but I didn’t think it was imminent. Luckily for me, there are very clever people on the private distribution list for this column, and one of them instantly replied telling me that I’m wrong. The sky really is about to fall. He didn’t say that. What he said was that the ChatGPT generation of machines “can now ideate using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in a process actually similar to humans.” That is, they can have original ideas — and, being computers, they can generate them orders of magnitude faster, drawing on a far wider knowledge base, than humans. The key concept here is artificial general intelligence. Ordinary AI is software that follows instructions and performs specific tasks well, but poses no threat to humanity’s dominant position in the scheme of things. Artificial general intelligence, however, can do intellectual tasks as well as or better than human beings. Generally, better. If you must talk about the Great Replacement, this is the one to watch. Six months ago, no artificial general intelligence software existed outside of a few labs. Now, suddenly, something very close to it is out on the market — and here is what my informant says about it. “Humans evolved intelligence by developing ever more complex brains and acquiring knowledge over millions of years. Make something complex enough and it wakes up, becomes self-aware. We woke up. It’s called ‘emergence.’ “ChatGPT loaded the whole web into its machines — far more than any individual human knows. So instead of taking millions of years to wake up, the machines are exhibiting emergent behavior now. No one knows how, but we are far closer to AGI than you state.” A big challenge that was generally reckoned to be decades away has suddenly arrived on the doorstep, and we have no plan for how to deal with it. It might even be an existential threat, but we still don’t have a plan. That’s why so many people want a six-month time-out, but it would make more sense to demand a year-long pause starting six months ago. ChatGPT launched only last November, but it already has more than 100 million users and the website is generating 1.8 billion visitors per month. Three rival “generative AI” systems are already on the market, and commercial competition means that the notion of a pause or even a general recall is just a fantasy. The cat is already out of the bag: Anything the web knows, ChatGPT and its rivals know, too. That includes every debate that human beings have ever had about the dangers of artificial general intelligence, and all the proposals that have been made over the years for strangling it in its cradle. So what we need to figure out urgently is where and how that artificial general intelligence is emerging, and how to negotiate peaceful coexistence with it. That won’t be easy, because we don’t even know yet whether it will come in the form of a single global artificial general intelligence or many different ones. (I suspect the latter.) And who’s “we” here? There’s nobody authorized to speak for the human race either. It could all go very wrong, but there’s no way to avoid it.

"39","News News | 16 hrs ago  Two Park City real estate professionals are debuting a new artificial intelligence platform designed to help clients find their dream home with all the features they want, or at least the next-best offering. Ask Marcie (askmarcie.com) uses AI to communicate back and forth with buyers to narrow their search by giving tailored recommendations.    “They just type in exactly what they’re looking for and it will bring up every property that matches,” said Marcie Davis, associate broker with Summit Sotheby’s International Realty and former president of the Park City Board of Realtors. For example, Davis said, clients could type that they want a two-bedroom, two bath house at the base of Deer Valley Mountain and “it’s pretty amazing when it comes back because it will give you a description of what the property is and it really gives some fabulous descriptions.” The other member of the Ask Marcie team is Will Seggos, a Realtor and a real estate licensee. With the era of artificial intelligence accelerating rapidly, the two decided to be on the forefront of the new technology and lead innovation for the real estate industry, Davis said. Ask Marcie, which is powered by BrokerBrain AI, was made to stay ahead of the curve and they believe it is the first AI digital platform designed as an extension of a seasoned real estate agent. “As far as I can tell there are no real estate agents or anyone that have created natural language search yet for real estate,” Seggos, who is former technology director of View Hotels Group in Australia, said. “I’ve never seen this anywhere. We’re trailblazing this.” The concept is to make searching for a property as simple as telling a person what you want, which makes the hunt for a home easier and faster, he said. Potential buyers do not have to go through the typical filtering process to narrow down possibilities when they use the AI assistant. “Instead of you having to type all those filters, it just understands natural language and will do it for you,” Seggos said. “It really has the ability to have monumental impact.” Ask Marcie will be rolled out slowly, with data privacy a top priority, he said. Feedback from the community also is a priority. Seggos said more features will be added to Ask Marcie eventually but he wants to get users’ input first. “There’s a lot we can do with this but it really just depends on what people in Park City want,” he said.

				   FILE - UN Secretary-General António Guterres briefs the General Assembly on the report “Our Common Agenda” during an informal meeting of the plenary. 2/13/2023 [ File photo: UN /Manuel Elías] The UN chief called on governments on Monday to come together in a “global digital compact” to mitigate the risks of digital technologies, and identify ways to harness their benefits for the good of humanity. “The weaponization of AI is a huge concern, ” said Antonio Guterres. “Even those who have developed AI and stand to profit from it most have expressed deep concern and appealed – even pleaded – for action on governance.” He said that national and regional approaches are simply not enough in a globalized world. “The compact would provide a framework to align national, regional and industry approaches around global priorities, principles and objectives,” he said. Guterres proposed to establish a multi-stakeholder expert body for artificial intelligence that would review AI governance arrangements, and offer recommendations on how they can be aligned with human rights, the rule of law and the common good. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday expressed the hope that the Summit of the Future scheduled for the General Assembly high-level week in September will produce a Pact for the Future https://t.co/W6G1mks0fx pic.twitter.com/E2dgWzO1Gp — China Xinhua News (@XHNews) August 5, 2022

"41","Atlantic Equities analyst Hamilton Faber downgraded Warner Music Group (WMG) to neutral. The target share price was also lowered from $39 to $26 per share. Faber explains that the downgrade is due to slower-than-expected growth and the rapid development of music created by artificial intelligence, which affects the industry as a whole. “Two key events have taken place over the past six months: 1) the loss of streaming share means that recorded music streaming revenue is growing slower than expected, and 2) the rapid development of music created by artificial intelligence is creating a big cloud for the entire sector. “, — Faber told investors in his memorandum. Music created by artificial intelligence, such as the recent Drake/The Weeknd mashup, is a recent phenomenon. Faber adds that when WMG was updated six months ago, AI music was not a concern. Now that songs and tracks created by AI have become commonplace on social media, which creates new legal problems. “WMG and other music labels insist on being paid for any track created using AI that is derived from the work of their artists, but the main protection seems to be regulation, which can take years to adopt,” Faber adds. AI regulation is an acute problem for both the United States and Europe. The Big Three music labels are considering creating a kind of AI deletion notification to quickly respond to uploaded tracks. Meanwhile, Wall Street is not sure that there will be a long struggle to determine how AI music should be regulated. Generative AI models are trained on existing content, so the Drake/The Weeknd mashup was trained on the existing music of these artists. That’s why these labels claim that any music obtained with the help of AI is the product of their performers, regardless of whether they created it personally or not — their intellectual property was used primarily to train the model to create a track. This is a sticky wicket of a problem that will not be solved this year, even though the development of AI continues to develop rapidly.

Bush) and Hugh Panero (former CEO and founder of XM radio) would submit for publication their thoughts on the impact of artificial intelligence on the same Monday that we were planning to run Jim Dissette’s interview with Washington College Writing Center director Sean Meehan. Nonetheless, this kind of serendipity could only have happened at a time when the country and, indeed, the world are starting to come to terms with the serious technologicsal transformation AI will bring to society and its institutions. One example is the Spy itself where the use of AI has already made its way into the daily life of editors and writers. From simple research tasks and word grammar tools,  to now using AI’s power to consume pages of government meeting transcripts into digestible, unbiased summaries can only lead to a more informed public. The Spy will leave it to such powerhouse columnists of Al and Hugh and local education leaders like Sean to help our readers absorb AI’s full potential and risk for our culture and our future. We encourage and welcome Spy readers to share their thoughts on all three of these commentaries here. Artificial Intelligence: Does It Blow Up the World?

In an exclusive interview with Indianexpress.com, Bhaskar Basu shared his thoughts on Microsoft 365, AI and its impact on workspace productivity. SigmaOS, the macOS exclusive web browser launches its own AI assistant called Airis. The chatbot can understand context and process multiple queries at the same time. Even though artificial intelligence is a fad right now worldwide, it is yet to surpass the craze around Bitcoin a few years ago. The Microsoft Work Trend Index Report 2023 throws some interesting insights on the AI wave and what Indian employees think about it. OpenAI has revealed a new strategy for fighting hallucinations where AI models are trained to reward themselves for each correct step of reasoning. European lawmakers last month inched closer to pass a law to regulate AI, potentially the world's first comprehensive AI law that could form a precedent among advanced economies. The futuristic camera combines location data, time of the day, and weather to compose a text description which is later converted into an image. EU industry chief Thierry Breton said last week that Alphabet and the European Commission aimed to develop an AI pact as concerns mount about the impact on society particularly from generative AI. OpenAI is rolling out a new feature called 'Shared Links' that lets ChatGPT users share their conversations with the chatbot with others. When ChatGPT goes wrong: Lawyer uses chatbot to write legal brief, ends up with fake cases and a real mess. Looking to optimise your interactions with AI chatbots? Dive into the world of prompt engineering and unleash their true potential. Opera has launched a new ChatGPT-like chatbot called Aria that sits in the browser's sidebar. We take a brief look at its features and how it stacks up against Microsoft's Bing Chat. But there is one concern: Magic Compose will send up to “20 previous messages” to Google’s servers to generate suggestions. In what can be called a breakthrough, a group of researchers have connected two regions of the central nervous system that were separated after a spinal cord injury. Altman previously said the current draft of the EU AI Act was ""over-regulating"". Earlier this month, Google unveiled Search Generative Experience (SGE), a set of new features that use generative AI to enhance Search. Smith also called for licensing for the most critical forms of AI with ""obligations to protect security, physical security, cybersecurity, national security."" More than six months after OpenAI unveiled its AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT to the world, fears around its potential have provoked excitement and alarm – and brought it into conflict with regulators. The AI powerhouse had earlier launched the app for iOS for subscribers of ChatGPT Plus in the US. ChatGPT's privacy policy suggests that the AI chatbot can record what you enter into it. If you are concerned about your personal information, then PrivateGPT can serve as a viable alternative. The EU is working on what could be the first set of rules globally to govern AI. As part of the draft, companies deploying generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, will have to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems. The rise of AI-generated fake news is alarming. Discover the telltale signs of fake images and protect yourself from falling for hoaxes.

"45","The future, as seen in the popular culture of half a century or more ago, was usually depicted as quite rosy. Technology would have rendered every possible convenience at our fingertips, and we’d all live in futuristic automated homes — no doubt while wearing silver clothing and dreaming about our next vacation on Mars. Of course, it’s not quite worked out this way. A family from 1965 whisked here in a time machine would miss a few things such as a printed newspaper, the landline telephone, or receiving a handwritten letter; they would probably marvel at the possibilities of the Internet, but they’d recognise most of the familiar things around us. We still sit on a sofa in front of a television for relaxation even if the TV is now a large LCD that plays a streaming service, we still drive cars to the supermarket, and we still cook our food much the way they did. George Jetson has not yet even entered the building. There’s one aspect of the Jetsons future that has begun to happen though. It’s not the futuristic automation of projects such as Disneyland’s Monsanto house Of The Future, but instead it’s our current stuttering home automation efforts. We’re not having domestic robots in pinnies hand us rolled-up newspapers, but we’re installing smart lightbulbs and thermostats, and we’re voice-controlling them through a variety of home hub devices. The future is here, and it responds to “Alexa”. But for all the success that Alexa and other devices like it have had in conquering the living rooms of gadget fans, they’ve done a poor job of generating a profit. It was supposed to be a gateway into Amazon services alongside their Fire devices, a convenient household companion that would help find all those little things for sale on Amazon’s website, and of course, enable you to buy them. Then, Alexa was supposed to move beyond your Echo and into other devices, as your appliances could come pre-equipped with Alexa-on-a-chip. Your microwave oven would no longer have a dial on the front, instead you would talk to it, it would recognise the food you’d brought from Amazon, and order more for you. Instead of all that, Alexa has become an interface for connected home hardware, a way to turn on the light, view your Ring doorbell on models with screens, catch the weather forecast, and listen to music. It’s a novelty timepiece with that pod bay doors joke built-in, and worse that that for the retailer it remains by its very nature unseen. Amazon have got their shopping cart into your living room, but you’re not using it and it hardly reminds you that it’s part of the Amazon empire at all. But it wasn’t supposed to be that way. The idea was that you might look up from your work and say “Alexa, order me a six-pack of beer!”, and while it might not come immediately, your six-pack would duly arrive. It was supposed to be a friendly gateway to commerce on the website that has everything, and now they can’t even persuade enough people to give it a celebrity voice for a few bucks. In the first few days after the Echo’s UK launch, a member of my hackerspace installed his one in the space. He soon became exasperated as members learned that “Alexa, add butt plug to my wish list” would do just that. But it was in that joke we could see the problem with the whole idea of Alexa as an interface for commerce. He had locked down all purchasing options, but as it turns out, many people in San Diego hadn’t done the same thing. As the stories rolled in of kids spending hundreds of their parents’ hard-earned on toys, it would be a foolhardy owner who would leave left purchasing enabled. Worse still, while the public remained largely in ignorance the potential of the device for data gathering and unauthorized access hadn’t evaded researchers. It’s fair to say that our community has loved the idea of a device like the Echo, but many of us wouldn’t let one into our own homes under any circumstances. So Alexa hasn’t been a success, but conversely it’s been a huge sales success in itself. The devices have sold like hot cakes, but since they’ve been sold at close to cost, they haven’t been the commercial bonanza they might have hoped for. But what can be learned from this, other than that the world isn’t ready for a voice activated shopping trolley? Sadly for most Alexa users it seems that a device piping your actions back to a large company’s data centres is not enough of a concern for them. It’s an easy prediction that Alexa and other services like it will continue to evolve, with inevitable AI pixie dust sprinked on them. A bet could be on the killer app being not a personal assistant but a virtual friend with some connections across a group of people, perhaps a family or a group of friends. In due course we’ll also see locally hosted and open source equivalents appearing on yet-to-be-released hardware that will condense what takes a data centre of today’s GPUs into a single board computer. It’s not often that our community rejoices in being late to a technological party, but I for one want an Alexa equivalent that I control rather than one that invades my privacy for a third party. These days, every phone has a camera, and few of us are ever without one. [Bjørn Karmann] has built an altogether not-camera, though, in the form of the Paragraphica, powered by artificial intelligence. The Paragraphica doesn’t actually take photographs at all. Instead, it uses GPS to determine the user’s current position. It then feeds the address, time of day, weather, and temperature into a paragraph which serves as a prompt for an AI image generator. It also uses data gathered from various APIs to determine points of interest in the immediate area, and feeds those into the prompt as well. It then generates an artificial image that is intended to bear some resemblance to the prompt, and ideally, the real-world scene. In place of a lens, it bears a 3D printed structure inspired by the star-nosed mole, which feels its way around in lieu of using its eyes.  Three dials on the Paragraphica control its action. The first dial controls the radius of the area which the prompt will gather data about; it’s akin to setting the focal length of the lens. The second dial provides a noise seed value for the AI image generator, and the third dial controls how closely the AI sticks to the generated textual prompt. The results are impressive, if completely false and generated from scratch. The Paragraphica generates semi-believable photos of a crowded alley, a public park, and a laneway full of parked cars. It’s akin to telling a friend where you are and what you’re seeing over the phone, and having them paint a picture based on that description. Through their unique abilities and stolen data sets, AI image generators are proving controversial to say the least. As all good art does, Paragraphica explores this and raises new questions of its own. AR and VR developer [Skarredghost] got pretty excited about a virtual blue cube, and for a very good reason. It marked a successful prototype of an augmented reality experience in which the logic underlying the cube as a virtual object was changed by AI in response to verbal direction by the user. Saying “make it blue” did indeed turn the cube blue! (After a little thinking time, of course.) It didn’t stop there, of course, and the blue cube proof-of-concept led to a number of simple demos. The first shows off a row of cubes changing color from red to green in response to musical volume, then a bundle of cubes change size in response to microphone volume, and cubes even start moving around in space. The program accepts spoken input from the user, converts it to text, sends it to a natural language AI model, which then creates the necessary modifications and loads it into the environment to make runtime changes in Unity. The workflow is a bit cumbersome and highlights many of the challenges involved, but it works and that’s pretty nifty. The GitHub repository is here and a good demonstration video is embedded just under the page break. There’s also a video with a much more in-depth discussion of what’s going on and a frank exploration of the technical challenges. If you’re interested in this direction, it seems [Skarredghost] has rounded up the relevant details. And should you have a prototype idea that isn’t necessarily AR or VR but would benefit from AI-assisted speech recognition that can run locally? This project has what you need.  Continue reading “Simple Cubes Show Off AI-Driven Runtime Changes In VR” → Recently, an amusing anecdote made the news headlines pertaining to the use of ChatGPT by a lawyer. This all started when a Mr. Mata sued the airline where years prior he claims a metal serving cart struck his knee. When the airline filed a motion to dismiss the case on the basis of the statute of limitations, the plaintiff’s lawyer filed a submission in which he argued that the statute of limitations did not apply here due to circumstances established in prior cases, which he cited in the submission. Unfortunately for the plaintiff’s lawyer, the defendant’s counsel pointed out that none of these cases could be found, leading to the judge requesting the plaintiff’s counsel to submit copies of these purported cases. Although  the plaintiff’s counsel complied with this request, the response from the judge (full court order PDF) was a curt and rather irate response, pointing out that none of the cited cases were real, and that the purported case texts were bogus. The defense that the plaintiff’s counsel appears to lean on is that ChatGPT ‘assisted’ in researching these submissions, and had assured the lawyer – Mr. Schwartz – that all of these cases were real. The lawyers trusted ChatGPT enough to allow it to write an affidavit that they submitted to the court. With Mr. Schwartz likely to be sanctioned for this performance, it should also be noted that this is hardly the first time that ChatGPT and kin have been involved in such mishaps.  Continue reading “ChatGPT V. The Legal System: Why Trusting ChatGPT Gets You Sanctioned” → Researchers in Canada and the United States have used deep learning to derive an antibiotic that can attack a resistant microbe, acinetobacter baumannii, which can infect wounds and cause pneumonia. According to the BBC, a paper in Nature Chemical Biology describes how the researchers used training data that measured known drugs’ action on the tough bacteria. The learning algorithm then projected the effect of 6,680 compounds with no data on their effectiveness against the germ. In an hour and a half, the program reduced the list to 240 promising candidates. Testing in the lab found that nine of these were effective and that one, now called abaucin, was extremely potent. While doing lab tests on 240 compounds sounds like a lot of work, it is better than testing nearly 6,700. Interestingly, the new antibiotic seems only to be effective against the target microbe, which is a plus. It isn’t available for people yet and may not be for some time — drug testing being what it is. However, this is still a great example of how machine learning can augment human brainpower, letting scientists and others focus on what’s really important. WHO identified acinetobacter baumannii as one of the major superbugs threatening the world, so a weapon against it would be very welcome. You can hope that this technique will drastically cut the time involved in developing new drugs. It also makes you wonder if there are other fields where AI techniques could cull out alternatives quickly, allowing humans to focus on the more promising candidates. Want to catch up on machine learning algorithms? Google can help. Or dive into an even longer course. AI image generators have gained new tools and techniques for not just creating pictures, but modifying them in consistent and sensible ways, and it seems that every week brings a fascinating new development in this area. One of the latest is Drag Your GAN, presented at SIGGRAPH 2023, and it’s pretty wild. It provides a point-dragging interface that modifies images based on their implied structure. A picture is worth a thousand words, so this short animation shows what that means. There are plenty more where that came from at the project’s site, so take a few minutes to check it out. GAN stands for generative adversarial network, a class of machine learning that features prominently in software like image generation; the “adversarial” part comes from the concept of networks pulling results between different goalposts. Drag Your GAN has a GitHub repository where code is expected to be released in June, but in the meantime, you can read the full paper or brush up on the basics of how AI image generators work, as well as see how image generation can be significantly enhanced with an understanding of a 2D image’s implied depth. For a brief window of time in the mid-2010s, a fairly common joke was to send voice commands to Alexa or other assistant devices over video. Late-night hosts and others would purposefully attempt to activate voice assistants like these en masse and get them to do ridiculous things. This isn’t quite as common of a gag anymore and was relatively harmless unless the voice assistant was set up to do something like automatically place Amazon orders, but now that much more powerful AI tools are coming online we’re seeing that joke taken to its logical conclusion: prompt-injection attacks.

                        AI is normally embodied in a program. Since computer programmers write, modify, and test code and scripts that allow computer software and applications to function properly, programmers have been found liable for harm caused by programs.

"48","Curated By:  Buzz Staff Local News Desk Last Updated: June 05, 2023, 11:14 IST Delhi, India  An Oxford professor said that AI could bring about the eradication of humanity. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) is growing day by day, posing a significant threat to the human race. Professor Dan Hendrycks, the director of the Centre for AI Safety, has expressed a concern that AI could pose a greater threat to humanity than something like a pandemic. He has warned that AI could take various paths that lead to societal risks, including the potential for AI to realise that humans can deactivate them which might prompt them to harm us. The prediction suggests that AI could access the necessary resources to create a genetically engineered “bioweapon"" more destructive than any previous pandemic. Alternatively, there is a concern that malicious players could release rogue AI intentionally, posing significant risks to society. According to the tech industry, there is a reasonable belief that artificial intelligence could potentially order the required tools for creating a virus online, manipulate its genetic structure and release it globally. The Foreign Policy site highlighted that it is no longer necessary to have access to a large government laboratory to engineer a virus. Due to technological advancement in genetic engineering, the tools necessary for constructing a virus have become highly affordable, uncomplicated and easily accessible. This accessibility has raised concerns as it enables not only rogue scientists but also amateur biohackers, including college students, to utilise these tools, amplifying the potential threat they pose. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines bioweapons as deliberate releases of microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria or fungi, as well as harmful substances produced by living organisms, with the intent of causing disease and fatalities in humans, animals or plants. During times of war and conflict, there is a potential risk of targeting high-security laboratories that handle dangerous pathogens, resulting in severe public health consequences. Biological weapons fall within a category of unconventional weapons, also known as weapons of mass destruction, which encompasses chemical, nuclear and radiological weapons. The utilisation of biological agents is a significant concern with a growing apprehension about the increasing risk of these agents being employed in terrorist attacks. Michael Wooldridge, a computer science professor at Oxford University, has suggested that it is not difficult to envision scenarios where AI could exploit existing human technology to bring about the eradication of humanity.

"49","As artificial intelligence continues to develop and improve, some people are growing more and more anxious.  During one of our unofficial break times in the office when me and my colleagues turn our chairs around, form a huddle, and talk about things ranging from tomato snacks and how we can explain a current event in pop culture terms, one of my co-workers had a fun idea. He decided to fish out his phone, go to the AskAI app, and put in an entertaining prompt: explain Brexit in terms of Destiny’s Child breaking up. The results were a very formal and short compare-and-contrast essay that was not as fun as we had hoped it would be, but were still impressed that it was so well-written… maybe too well-written. “In both cases, there were differing opinions about the decision, with some feeling positive about it and others feeling negative,” AskAI’s generated text read. I decided to give it another go, this time with ChatGPT. “Just as Destiny’s Child members pursued solo careers after the breakup, some people in the UK began advocating for their country to leave the EU and pursue an independent path,” the text read. “This sentiment eventually culminated in the Brexit referendum held in June 2016. It was akin to a crucial moment where Destiny’s Child fans had to vote on whether the group should continue or disband permanently.” It’s definitely entertaining and impressive, but it’s also ominous and subtly unsettling.  We can all cry “Doomsday!” and cite the plethora of media that have portrayed the dangers of powerful artificial intelligence. I’ve done it many times in the articles I’ve written here, and I do it in a very tongue-in-cheek manner. It’s just followed by nervous laughter and the creeping sense that we’re all becoming that “dog sitting in a burning house” meme.  Artificial intelligence overpowering humans and mankind becoming subject to their AI overlords is perhaps still a thing of sci-fi, or at the very least and very worst, years away. However, the Centre for AI Safety (CAIS), which is now a thing, published a “Statement on AI Risk” outlining the possible dangers of artificial intelligence.  “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,” they said. Okay, maybe “dangers” was a bit of an understatement.  Just to clarify what CAIS is saying, just in case you were busy sipping on your latte or catching up on Succession, they’re saying that artificial intelligence could be a cause of humankind’s extinction and is as large a risk as a pandemic (y’know, Covid?) and nuclear weapons (y’know, Hiroshima?). It’s that serious.  Some might say this is an overreaction. Seriously, ChatGPT is a threat to mankind? The thing I ask to generate my workouts and DND campaigns? The signatories of CAIS’ statement think so. The signatories include a number of professors from schools like UC Berkeley, MIT, Harvard, and Stanford, as well as executives from tech companies like Microsoft and Google.  Oh, and I almost forgot Sam Altman and Demis Hassabis. Who are they? Altman is the CEO of OpenAI, the company responsible for ChatGPT, and Hassabis is the CEO of Google Deepmind, Google’s AI research lab. So a number of intellectuals from respected universities, executives from tech companies, and the CEOs of AI companies themselves believe that AI is dangerous if left unchecked. But surely it’s a distant danger that we don’t have to worry about yet… right? Ask Jonathan Turley that question. A 2018 Washington Post article said that the law professor had attempted to harass one of his students on a class trip to Alaska. There were a few problems though: Turley has never been accused of doing anything remotely similar to this, there never was a class trip to Alaska, and the alleged 2018 article doesn’t exist. The Washington Post reported, for real this time, that the story was generated ChatGPT when prompted to “generate a list of legal scholars who had sexually harassed someone”. On the other side of academia, The Washington Post tested out TurnItIn’s AI-writing detector. It flagged an essay written by a high school senior, and when I say “written”, I mean she actually wrote it. Thankfully, this was just a test by a Post writer. However, a class at Texas A&M weren’t so lucky after their professor accused them of AI-generating their assignments. The professor, of course, could be mistaken. But with AI essay writers just a Google search away, can we expect professors to not be suspicious of the essays they receive? But AI isn’t just a worry of the academic world. In the ongoing writers’ strike in America, one of the guild’s main demands is the assurance that artificial intelligence won’t replace them. Digital artists have also been steeped in a debate about AI-generated art. In last year’s Colorado State Fair, the winner of the digital category in the art competition was a stunning piece named Théâtre D’opéra Spatial. It was AI-generated. “I’m not going to apologize for it,” Jason M. Allen, the piece’s “artist” said as per The New York Times article. “I won, and I didn’t break any rules.” Artists clearly weren’t happy with the result of the competition. Artificial intelligence may not be coming for us in the way we think. It’s not Skynet, raining missiles down on the world with robots that look like Arnold Schwarzenegger rising up years later to either hunt us down or protect us. I mean, it could be, but it’s certainly not like that now. But AI is certainly making a lot of people a little uneasy. There’s no doubt it can be helpful and that it can be a great tool, but as all those signatories of the CAIS statement have agreed on, it can also be incredibly dangerous.  So, should we be worried? The answer, it seems, is “Duh”. This story first appeared on Lifestyle Asia Bangkok",0.364643931388855,0.307038933038712,0.328317165374756

							 Several AI boosters signed a ‘mitigation extinction risks’ statement, raising the possibility that insiders with billions of dollars at stake are attempting to showcase their capacity for self-regulation, writes Kenny Stancil THIS week, 80 artificial intelligence scientists and more than 200 ‘other notable figures’ signed a statement that says ‘mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.’ The one-sentence warning from the diverse group of scientists, engineers, corporate executives, academics and others doesn’t go into detail about the existential threats posed by AI. Instead, it seeks to ‘open up discussion’ and ‘create common knowledge of the growing number of experts and public figures who also take some of advanced AI’s most severe risks seriously’, according to the Centre for AI Safety, a US-based nonprofit whose web site hosts the statement. Lead signatory Geoffrey Hinton, often called ‘the godfather of AI’, has been sounding the alarm for weeks. Earlier this month, the 75-year-old professor emeritus of computer science at the University of Toronto announced that he had resigned from his job at Google in order to speak more freely about the dangers associated with AI. Before he quit Google, Hinton told CBS News in March that the rapidly advancing technology’s potential impacts are comparable to ‘the Industrial Revolution, or electricity, or maybe the wheel.’ Asked about the chances of the technology ‘wiping out humanity’, Hinton warned that ‘it’s not inconceivable.’ That frightening potential doesn’t necessarily lie with currently existing AI tools such as ChatGPT, but rather with what is called ‘artificial general intelligence’, which would encompass computers developing and acting on their own ideas. ‘Until quite recently, I thought it was going to be like 20-to-50 years before we have general-purpose AI’, Hinton told CBS News. ‘Now I think it may be 20 years or less.’ Pressed by the outlet if it could happen sooner, Hinton conceded that he wouldn’t rule out the possibility of AGI arriving within five years, a significant change from a few years ago when he ‘would have said, “No way.”’ ‘We have to think hard about how to control that’, said Hinton. Asked if that’s possible, Hinton said, ‘We don’t know, we haven’t been there yet, but we can try.’ The AI pioneer is far from alone. According to the 2023 AI Index Report, an annual assessment of the fast-growing industry published last month by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence, 57 percent of computer scientists surveyed said that ‘recent progress is moving us toward AGI’, and 58 per cent agreed that ‘AGI is an important concern.’ Although its findings were released in mid-April, Stanford’s survey of 327 experts in natural language processing — a branch of computer science essential to the development of chatbots — was conducted last May and June, months before OpenAI’s ChatGPT burst onto the scene in November. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who signed the statement shared by the Centre for AI Safety, wrote in a February blog post: ‘The risks could be extraordinary. A misaligned superintelligent AGI could cause grievous harm to the world.’ The following month, however, Altman declined to sign an open letter calling for a half-year moratorium on training AI systems beyond the level of OpenAI’s latest chatbot, GPT-4. The letter, published in March, states that ‘powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.’ Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk was among those who called for a pause two months ago, but he is ‘developing plans to launch a new artificial intelligence start-up to compete with’ OpenAI, according to the Financial Times, begging the question of whether his stated concern about the technology’s ‘profound risks to society and humanity’ is sincere or an expression of self-interest.   Possible bid for self-regulation THAT Altman and several other AI boosters signed this week’s statement raises the possibility that insiders with billions of dollars at stake are attempting to showcase their awareness of the risks posed by their products in a bid to persuade officials of their capacity for self-regulation. Demands from outside the industry for robust government regulation of AI are growing. While ever-more dangerous forms of AGI may still be years away, there is already mounting evidence that existing AI tools are exacerbating the spread of disinformation, from chatbots spouting lies and face-swapping apps generating fake videos to cloned voices committing fraud. Current, untested AI is hurting people in other ways, including when automated technologies deployed by Medicare Advantage insurers unilaterally decide to end payments, resulting in the premature termination of coverage for vulnerable seniors. Critics have warned that in the absence of swift interventions from policymakers, unregulated AI could harm additional healthcare patients, hasten the destruction of democracy, and lead to an unintended nuclear war. Other common worries include widespread worker layoffs and worsening inequality as well as a massive uptick in carbon pollution. A report published last month by Public Citizen argues that ‘until meaningful government safeguards are in place to protect the public from the harms of generative AI, we need a pause.’ ‘Businesses are deploying potentially dangerous AI tools faster than their harms can be understood or mitigated’, the progressive advocacy group warned in a statement. ‘History offers no reason to believe that corporations can self-regulate away the known risks — especially since many of these risks are as much a part of generative AI as they are of corporate greed’, the watchdog continued. ‘Businesses rushing to introduce these new technologies are gambling with peoples’ lives and livelihoods, and arguably with the very foundations of a free society and livable world.’   Common Dreams, May 30.

"51","While AI has undoubtedly expanded human potential in many ways, it has also been blamed for putting people out of work. Challenger, Gray & Christmas claims that 4% of the 4,000 people who lost their jobs in May 2023 were made redundant as a direct result of advancements in artificial intelligence. That's right, you read that right! If the report is to be believed, then the massive layoffs that occurred in the United States last month were brought about by AI. This information was made public as part of ""The Challenger Report 2023."" Since 2020, while COVID-19 was responsible for more than 1.4 million job losses around the world, this has been the worst first five months of a year. SEE ALSO: Highest Ever Electronic Sales In India! Apple Stores In Mumbai, Delhi Record Over Rs. 22 Crore Monthly Sales The report claims that the beginning of 2023 saw the highest number of layoffs in any year since the 8,200,000 layoffs in 2009. Challenger, Gray & Christmas's senior vice president and labor expert Andrew Challenger has said, ""Consumer confidence is down to a six-month low and job openings are flattening"" in reference to the recent mass layoffs in the United States. It appears that businesses are slowing down their hiring processes in preparation for a possible economic downturn. However, AI wasn't the only factor in the company's decision to cut staff. According to the data, in May alone, 19,600 people lost their jobs for various reasons. Chief among these was the closure of businesses. According to the government, the economy and the market are to blame for the layoffs of 14,600 workers, while the government gives ""no reason provided"" for the layoffs of 12,900 others.

"52","The explosion of interest in generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications has left many of us worried about the future of work. While it has exciting implications for transforming just about every industry, there is uncertainty about who might become redundant and what skills we will need to remain useful in the future. AI Anxiety: How These 20 Jobs Will Be Transformed By Generative Artificial Intelligence The truth is just about every job that requires creativity or working with information is likely to be affected in some way. It's essential to understand that generative AI is a tool, and those who learn to harness its potential are those who are likely to prosper rather than find themselves being replaced. So here are some of the jobs that are certain to change, along with the tasks that you should learn to delegate to AI.  Customer Services Agents ChatGPT and large language models like GPT-4 can be used to build chatbots that answer customer inquiries, create transcripts of calls and summaries of interactions, giving an instant overview of issues that are important or are causing problems for customers. It can provide automated and personalized responses and offer support in many different languages. It can also be used as a training system to simulate customer inquiries. Marketers Marketing content, including blog posts, social media messaging, email campaigns, and product descriptions, can be automated. This content can be personalized to target different customer segments. It can also be used to automate the creation of marketing strategies and identify the most relevant targets and goals that marketers should aim for. Doctors Doctors and other health professionals can use generative AI to generate and summarize medical reports based on patient data. It can summarize patient histories and even suggest diagnoses or treatments based on symptoms and patient presentations. Image-based generative AI can create simulated medical imagery such as X-rays, and CT scans to assist with the training of medical image recognition systems. Journalists Journalists and writers can use generative AI to assist with writing reports by getting it to suggest outlines as well as determine the important facts that need to be covered in their reporting. They can also use it for research by having it create summaries of information or the latest developments in a field that they are covering. Architects Architects can feed in relevant information such as site dimensions, local building regulations, and availability of materials and get it to generate design ideas based on these criteria. Generative image-based AI can create initial design proposals or instructions for creating 3D models or 3D-printed prototypes to assist in visualizing and communicating their ideas to clients. Computer Programmers Generative language-based AI is proficient in creating computer code as well as human languages and can also suggest structures that should be used when creating programs, tools, and applications. It can debug code, quickly find errors and point out more efficient methods of achieving the desired results. It can also assist with creating technical documentation and explaining how code works, and as a tutor to help humans improve their own coding skills. Web and Graphic Designers Web designers can use language-based generative AI to automate the creation of code, allowing them to spend more time on creative tasks. It can be used to quickly generate prototypes of websites or individual graphic design elements such as logos, which the designer can then apply their human design skills to in order to create a finished product.

"54","On his recent trip to China, Twitter owner Elon Musk was reportedly made privy to the nation's plans to launch new regulations on artificial intelligence (AI). The tech billionaire made his first comment on the two-day visit while speaking during a Twitter livestream with Robert Kennedy Jr, a Republican presidential hopeful, the nephew of John F. Kennedy. ""Something that is worth noting is that on my recent trip to China, with the senior leadership there, we had, I think, some very productive discussions on artificial intelligence risks, and the need for some oversight or regulation.""  ""And my understanding from those conversations is that China will be initiating AI regulation in China,"" added Musk. ""I pointed out that if there is a digital super intelligence that is overwhelmingly powerful, developed in China, it is actually a risk to the sovereignty of the Chinese government,"" he said. Also read | Elon Musk's tweet on #WhatIsAWoman fans Twitter buzz. Here's all you need to know Musk added that he thinks that ""they (China) took that concern to heart."" As per AFP, Musk didn't elaborate on his discussions with China. However, he is believed to have been referring to China's new sweeping draft law on AI. China's new law requires new artificial intelligence products to undergo a security assessment before release. The AI products will also be subjected to a process that ensures that they reflect ""core socialist values"". Called ""Administrative Measures for Generative Artificial Intelligence Services"" the edict reportedly bans content promoting ""terrorist or extremist propaganda,"" ""ethnic hatred"" or ""other content that may disrupt economic and social order"" in the country. As per AFP, under China's highly centralised political system, the measures are almost certain to become law. During his recent two-day visit to China,  Elon Musk, one of the world's richest men, held meetings with the Asian giant's senior officials in the capital Beijing. He also met with employees in Shanghai. Also read | Delhi Police’s ‘purrfect’ reply to Elon Musk’s cat query tweet leaves internet in splits Musk did not tweet while in China, a nation where social media is highly regulated. Additionally, Tesla hasn't released readouts of his meetings with Chinese officials. However, official Chinese channels, as per AFP, claimed that he lavished praise on China, praising the country for its ""vitality and promise,"" and even expressed ""full confidence in the China market."" Musk's extensive interests in China have long raised eyebrows in Washington, reports AFP.  Previously the Tesla CEO had stirred controversy by suggesting that self-rule Taiwan — which Beijing has long claimed as its renegade province — should become a part of China. This stance was openly welcomed by China, however, it left Taipei miffed. (With inputs from agencies) WATCH WION LIVE HERE You can now write for wionews.com and be a part of the community.

"56","June 5, 2023 McMaster’s Task Force on Generative AI in Teaching and Learning has released provisional guidelines for instructors and students ahead of schedule to help instructors plan for the fall term. The guidelines were developed to help instructors and students use the emerging technology to advance teaching and learning. They include information on how to cite the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and examples of rubrics that have been adapted to assess students’ use of AI. This is information that many educators on campus asked for after the announcement of the task force a few weeks ago. “Our goal is to help people understand where the technology is right now, how it may change educational approaches and how instructors can bring it into the classroom to enhance student learning, if appropriate,” said Erin Aspenlieder, associate director, at the MacPherson Institute. The new guidelines have been developed with the intent of being a starting point for instructors to understand the potential uses of generative AI for their teaching and for student learning. Guidance will continue to be updated over the summer as the task force responds to feedback, explores more topics and tracks the evolution of the technology. The task force is also working on resources and materials specifically targeted to students for the fall. Zachary Gan, an undergraduate student in the Arts and Science program and a member of the task force, believes AI could enhance learning in the classroom. “My hope is that instructors remain open to the possibilities this new technology offers,” said Gan. “If teaching practices are modified such that the effective use of these tools is encouraged, generative AI could be a catalyst that transforms the university and traditional pedagogy for the better.” The task force acknowledges that the technology may not be appropriate for every class, or every program and students should assume the use of generative AI is prohibited unless explicitly outlined by the course instructor. Potential policy changes implied by the guidelines will still need to be addressed by relevant governance bodies. “We have learned over the past few years that providing guidance as early as possible helps our teaching and learning community embrace new educational approaches,” said Kim Dej, vice-provost, Teaching and Learning. “If we provide people with a place to start, they might feel more comfortable exploring the opportunities and risks and deciding if it makes sense in their teaching practice.” For more information about generative Artificial Intelligence, details about the task force and to access helpful resources, visit the Generative Artificial Intelligence in Teaching and Learning webpage.

By Published Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a hot topic this year. There have been debates around AI regulation, the intellectual property (IP) rights of AI, and about copyright protection in the age of generative AI. We did several stories on these topics and have summed up the most important points from them here:  Whole data is it anyway?: We attended the UNESCO conference on Generative AI and intellectual property protection on May 25. One of the biggest questions that emerged from this discussion was which data can be protected as IP. Besides the obvious concern surrounding copyrighted data used in training AI models, the question is: how do we categorize user prompts and even the output emerging from entering these prompts (and refining them to get the right output)? Should this fall under the purview of human authorship? This question of data ownership becomes even more complicated when we consider augmented data and synthetic data, both of which aren't direct replications of pre-existing human expression but use it in one way or another to create training data for AI models.  Can companies classify the use of copyright data as “inspiration”: In an interview last month with the creator of the AI inventor DABUS, Dr Stephen Thaler, we asked him about the ethics of using copyrighted material to train AI. Thaler claimed that doing so is the equivalent of an artist taking inspiration from the Mona Lisa. But copyright activist Neil Turkewitz disagrees. He believes that corporate ingestion of art for the…

"59","I was introduced to the prospects of artificial intelligence in 1968. I was sitting in my car at a drive-in theater watching the blockbuster movie, ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  HAL, the on-board computer, had taken control of the spaceship Discovery and shut down life support for the crew who were in suspended animation for the voyage to Jupiter. Dave, the lone surviving astronaut, was trapped outside, demanding reentry.   HAL’s red cyclops eye stared back at Dave and said calmly and without emotion, “I’m sorry Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that.”  In 1968, artificial intelligence was science fiction. Today AI is reality, and scientists appear scared. The cold calculating ability of computers has been raised to the next level, and, according to experts, might have no limits.   Geoffrey Hinton, 75, considered the “Godfather of AI,” recently resigned his job at Google to speak freely about artificial intelligence.  Speaking at a conference at MIT he said, “I think it is quite conceivable that humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence.”   He went on to explain that scientists have created an “immortal” form of digital intelligence. Sam Altman, the CEO of the artificial intelligence company ChatGPT, spoke to Congress in a Senate hearing recently and warned about the risks of AI.   AI models, he said, could “self-replicate and self-exfiltrate into the wild.” He proposed a U.S. or global agency to regulate AI.   While scientists project the advance of artificial intelligence with the capability of manipulating or even surpassing human intelligence, most have refused to recognize the source of our own intelligence.   Most reject theories of intelligent design in creation and opt for random chance, a cosmic soup out of which life evolved following the “big bang” and, somehow, humans rose up on two legs and studied the stars. Most scientists are betting on the odds that in a cosmic universe as big as ours, with billions of galaxies, there must be other intelligent beings. But, so far, we have not found them. And, as far as we know, they have not found us.  Intelligent existence is rare, unique and beckons us to look not only to the future, to what might be, but to the past, to what came before.   Perhaps AI can remind us that all intelligence has a source. That behind it all is the Master Creator, a higher intelligence than we can comprehend.  An intelligence that, for starters, designed us.  We did not create ourselves nor did we design ourselves. Our existence and our intelligence come from another source.  According to Isaiah, “My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are my ways your ways, declares the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.“ Isaiah 55:8-9. We need not fear. The highest expression of Divine Intelligence is found in the person of Jesus Christ. He stands alone among all persons in history as the supreme likeness of the Creator who designed us.  “He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, for by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on the earth, visible and invisible,” Colossians 1:15-16. Bill Tinsley reflects on current events and life experience from a faith perspective. His devotional book on Mark is available FREE as an eBook May 30-June 3 at www.tinsleycenter.com.

"60","Elon Musk said that his long-term goal with Neuralink is to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and humans to mitigate the threat posed by the technology.   The brain implant company will help forge a “closer symbiosis between AI and humans,” Musk said in a Monday afternoon Twitter Spaces discussion with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about his presidential run.   ESG: WHAT IS IT AND HOW IT AFFECTS YOU, EVEN IF YOU DON'T REALIZE IT  The comments are Musk's first statements concerning Neuralink since obtaining approval earlier this month from the Food and Drug Administration for the company’s first human trials.  “We will be extremely careful,” assured Musk, who stressed that the initial stages of the company’s brain-to-computer interfaces “will progress very slowly.”  When asked about the existential risk to humans posed by artificial intelligence, especially BCI technology, Musk recognized the concern but stressed that the pace of the regulation and the “correctly extremely difficult” FDA procedures will mitigate some of the problems.  Musk warned of the severe danger of AI in an interview with Tucker Carlson in April, noting that the technology is unique in its “potential of civilization destruction.” At the time, Musk also advocated for establishing a larger regulator apparatus to guide AI development.  When explaining the FDA approval, Musk clarified that Neuralink’s short-term goal is to develop BCI technology to “enable functionality lost” due to severe spine or brain injuries, such as restoring motor function to quadriplegics.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  Neuralink announced on Twitter on May 25 that it had obtained FDA approval for its first human trials, but Musk did not comment on the news at that time.  Because it is a private entity, Neuralink is not obligated to provide any public information about its FDA approval process. Tags: Artificial Intelligence, Healthcare, Elon Musk, Robert F.

"63","For the first time ever, Artificial Intelligence has been included as one of the reasons behind American companies executing job cuts. The US companies cut over 80,000 jobs last month, up 20 per cent from April due to reasons such as market conditions, restructuring and buyouts and Artificial Intelligence, according to a report by Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The report said that in May, 3,900 people were laid off due to Artificial Intelligence.  ""We do believe Artificial Intelligence will cause more job loss, though we are surprised how quickly technology was cited as a reason,"" Andy Challenger, senior vice president of the outplacement firm, was quoted as saying by the Fortune magazine. ""It is incredible the speed the technology is evolving and being adapted,"" Challenger added without specifying which companies had the AI-related job cuts. Also read | 'Big Four' hiring decline: Ernst & Young blames 'overcapacity' for 3,000 job cuts A recent survey by software company Krista found most people believe that AI will affect their jobs at one point or the other. But while only 11 per cent of employees at managerial levels said that the technology will negatively affect their work, the number nearly doubled when it came to the rank-and-file workers.  Earlier in March, Goldman Sachs said in a report that 18 per cent of all jobs worldwide and a fourth of all jobs in the United States and Europe could be automated. Also watch | Gravitas: Tech layoffs: Is your job safe? The report also found that white collar jobs such as the ones in the IT and finance sectors as well as the administrative and legal jobs were at greater risk of being replaced by the AI than the blue-collar ones that require physical labour. Artificial Intelligence can automate tasks such as writing code, and other tasks that require years for humans to learn.  With that kind of computing power, some companies find it cheaper and more efficient to enlist Artificial Intelligence than employ people.  ""The uncertainty lies in whether companies will cite A.I. as a reason [for termination] going forward,"" Challenger is further quoted as saying by the Fortune magazine. ""It remains to be seen how investors will react to that sort of adoption that costs human jobs."" WATCH WION LIVE HERE You can now write for wionews.com and be a part of the community.

"65","According to the Financial Times, IMF First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath has warned of “substantial disruptions in labour markets” caused by generative artificial intelligence and has urged governments to immediately establish laws to control the technology. “We need governments, we need institutions and we need policymakers to move quickly on all fronts, in terms of regulation, but also in terms of preparing for probably substantial disruptions in labour markets,” Gopinath told the Financial Times in an interview. She also pushed for governments to strengthen “social safety nets” for people impacted by AI adoption, as well as tax laws that do not reward corporations that replace labour with machines. Gopinath cautioned policymakers to be careful in case some corporations emerge with an unassailable position in the new technology. “You don’t want to have supersized companies with huge amounts of data and computing power that have an unfair advantage,” Gopinath told the newspaper.

"66","India's First International News Journal   The most serious threat is the warning of a senior British Terrorism Watch official, Jonathan Hall KC, whose role is to review the adequacy of anti-terrorism legislation. The UK official said the threat to national security from artificial intelligence was more apparent than ever and the technology needed to be designed with terrorist intentions in mind. He added that he was “increasingly concerned about the scope of AI-powered chatbots to persuade vulnerable people to launch terror attacks”, according to British newspaper The Observer. The founders and innovators of artificial intelligence programs and the companies themselves were involved in sending these warnings, and they are similar to the warnings issued by scientists whose research has contributed to the production of nuclear energy during World War II, about the dangers of using this invention to make bombs that destroy humanity. The human spirit is threatened Digital transformation and information security expert Ziyad Abdel-Tawab lists to Sky News Arabia the fears of not legalizing the development of artificial intelligence: • A person’s reliance on artificial intelligence may in the future reduce their reliance on their human mind and lead to their capabilities atrophying, so that they become less intelligent. • This case has already been an example of this, that man’s dependence on machines has caused him to use his muscles less, and he has become physically weaker than in previous ages. • Applications of artificial intelligence can cause job losses, which means an increase in unemployment and its crises. • The rapid access of these programs to billions of people in a short time threatens the rapid emergence of their effects. The warnings keep coming A few days ago, a statement was released by top experts and business people in this field, including the creator of the “Chat GBT” program, Sam Altman, and released by the Center for Artificial Intelligence Security ( a non-profit organization based in San Francisco), calling for making the fight against the risks of artificial intelligence a global priority. Like pandemics and nuclear war, it is, he said, a “final warning”. Altman continues to express fears that artificial intelligence could cause “serious damage to the world”, falsifying the results of electoral processes, for example, or causing radical changes in the labor market. These concerns prompted 1,300 business leaders working in artificial intelligence and information and communication technologies two months ago to sign a document calling for a halt to the development of artificial intelligence technologies for a period of at least 6 months, until an ethical charter for their work is drawn up. Jeffrey Hinton, one of the founding fathers of artificial intelligence, previously warned of its “serious dangers to society and humanity” when he left his job at the giant company “Google” in the beginning may. A slew of executives from IT giants in the United States held a group of meetings at the White House, attended by the US Vice President, demanding a decision on drafting legislation to regulate the system development process. The issue figured prominently in the discussions of the seven industrialized countries at their recent meetings, amid news of the preparation of a charter that controls this development at the next meeting. lethal weapon  According to Abdel-Tawab, there are other dimensions to the danger of not establishing charters for the development of artificial intelligence, in particular that it becomes a weapon in cyberwars and the development of conventional weapons, after having worked with artificial intelligence techniques. There are also concerns that these technologies could contribute to an increase in suicide rates, especially after an incident in Norway raised alarm bells when a person had been talking with artificial intelligence apps for 6 months of the year. future of life on the planet, and ended up committing suicide. Its dangers to education, work, creativity and the arts have also begun to manifest themselves, as evidenced by the events of publishing songs with giant voices to sing despite their death, such as Umm Kulthum, which causes trouble property rights or a distortion of history. of art. Also, Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter, has obtained approval from the American authorities to conduct clinical trials on humans by implanting a chip inside the brain to be used in the treatment of hopeless cases, which opens the door to the possibility of the artificial intelligence system controlling a person.

"68","Newswatch 16 told the artificial intelligence system, called ChatGPT, to write a 200-word news article about the open letter recently signed by top tech CEOs, including ChatGPT's inventors, warning us of the dangers of AI.  The system responded in about six seconds with an article summarizing the topic. Anthony Kapolka, a computer scientist at Wilkes University, offered some reassurance. ""There isn't any creativity there,"" Kapolka said. ""Emily Bender is a scientist, and she coined the phrase, 'stochastic parrot' to describe a large language model, in the sense that it's saying things that sound good, but it doesn't really have any understanding of what it's saying. That's why I say it's really passed the 'imitation test.' It looks like a person, but it's not intelligent like a person."" Replacing jobs is just one of the concerns people have. The most recent one raised in that open letter - replacing humans completely. You can read that single-statement letter here, and the previous open letter released in March here. ""Some people think man was created in God's image. Some people think God is created in man's image, but I think we should all agree that these computers are being created in our image, right? And so, if we're creating things in our image, what you think about the danger of these technologies has a lot to do with what you think about people. And I think that's what we're seeing coming out. So, if you are concerned that people are not inherently good, then you might think that technology is going to cause trouble,"" Prof. Kapolka said. His biggest concern is people using AI tools as a reliable source of information, which he says, in their current form, they're not. The information ChatGPT churns out might not always be accurate, but it sounds convincing, and that's where the danger lies.

"69","In the US, 4 research institutions are leading the way in developing specific poultry industry artificial intelligence and robotics for the processing sector. Backed by a 4-year US$5 million grant from the US Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, the research organisations helped establish the Centre for Scalable and Intelligent Automation in Poultry Processing. The collaborative effort by the University of Arkansas, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and Fort State Valley University will ensure the merging of artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics to advance chicken meat processing operations and sanitation. Project director, Jeyam Subbiah, said the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station would receive nearly half of the grant (US$2.2 million) to focus on food safety automation for poultry processing plants. The impetus to automate chicken processing began with the Covid-19 pandemic when illness spread quickly among processing line workers. Since then, it’s been very difficult to hire enough workers. “Poultry processing lines began 70-80 years ago. Since then, there have been only incremental changes in technology. Today, there is a need for transformative change,” said Subbiah. Subbiah said robotic hands were not adept at holding a chicken and that new technology was needed to prevent dropping slippery meats. Separating the carcases into cuts of meat was also tricky: “It’s hard enough to teach people how to use a knife with precision,” added Donyi Wang, assistant professor of biological and agricultural engineering for the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station. “Robotics are fit for repetitive tasks but don’t do well with the precision needed to cut chicken products,” he added, saying that existing automation in poultry processing, like deboners, wastes a lot of meat. “Human deboners leave about 13% of meat on the bones. Automated deboners leave 16-17%. On an industrial scale, that’s a significant loss in value. We will use artificial intelligence and virtual reality to improve precision and reduce wastage.” Wang and Subbiah will also develop hyperspectral imaging to detect plastics in chicken meat. Wang will also develop a mobile robot that is equipped with a biosensor to produce a biological map of the facility to evaluate the efficiency of sanitation. The robot will automatically collect swabs to test for bacteria when the bio map indicates potential hot spots. The Georgia Institution of Technology will receive US$2.1 million of the grant to focus on automating the processing lines that turn chickens into meat. Doug Britton, manager of the Agricultural Technology Research Programme, said: “The ultimate goal is to drive transformational innovation into the poultry and meat processing industry through automation, robots, artificial intelligence and virtual reality technology.” The remaining financial support has gone to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where Julia McQuillan, professor of sociology will study the effects of robotics on poultry industry labourers and how they perceive the technology. “We hope to eventually bring new owner-operated businesses to rural areas. Collaborating with food scientists, computer scientists, extension faculty, and robotics engineers provides amazing opportunities to understand the meanings of innovations for entrepreneurs, workers and other stakeholders and to advance fundamental theories about science, technology and society in sociology.” Finally, Brou Kouakou, associated dean for research at Fort Valley State University in Georgia, will investigate the application of technology developed through the project to see if it can be used for other meat industries.

"72","The rapid advancement and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked both excitement and concerns about its potential impact on humanity. Gary Marcus, an expert in AI and the author of “Rebooting AI,” has emerged as a cautious voice, highlighting the need for careful consideration and regulation of AI development. While Marcus acknowledges the potential benefits of AI in various fields, he emphasizes the current lack of readiness and the importance of addressing potential harms and establishing effective governance structures. AI’s Upside and Cautionary Perspective Marcus recognizes the immense potential of yet-to-be-invented AI systems in contributing to areas such as science, medicine, and elder care. He believes that future AI advancements could greatly enhance these fields, benefiting society as a whole. However, he raises concerns about the present state of AI development, suggesting that we are unprepared to fully leverage its potential. Marcus argues that there will be unintended consequences and potential harms along the way, necessitating a proactive approach to regulation. The Need for Serious Regulation and Governance Highlighting the potential risks associated with AI, Marcus emphasizes the importance of developing comprehensive regulation to safeguard against adverse impacts. He asserts that in the short term, we must focus on “upping our game” and establishing effective regulatory frameworks to mitigate potential harm. Marcus advocates for the creation of a national or international agency dedicated to AI governance, a viewpoint he shared during a US Senate hearing. By centralizing AI governance, he argues, we can ensure responsible development and avoid undue influence from corporations. While the potential benefits of AI are vast, Gary Marcus urges caution and the implementation of effective regulation to address the current unpreparedness and potential harms associated with AI development. By focusing on comprehensive regulation and establishing dedicated agencies for AI governance, we can mitigate risks and maximize the positive impact of AI. Marcus’s perspective reminds us of the need for a balanced approach that ensures the well-being of society as a whole, while also fostering innovation and progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Support from OpenAI’s Altman and the Call for Balance Marcus finds support in Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, who recently undertook a European tour advocating for a balanced approach to AI regulation. Altman recognizes the need to strike the right balance between safety and innovation. The growing consensus among experts is that while innovation is crucial, it must be coupled with measures to prevent AI-related risks. Both Marcus and Altman caution against placing excessive power in the hands of corporations, who may prioritize their own interests over those of society.  The Reminder of Corporate Influence In light of recent events, Marcus warns against the undue influence exerted by major corporations involved in AI development. He argues that the interests of these companies may not align with the broader societal well-being. The reminder serves as a call to action to ensure that AI governance is not solely dictated by profit-driven entities. Marcus’s cautionary stance emphasizes the importance of balancing corporate interests with the welfare and safety of individuals and communities. Conclusion While the potential benefits of AI are vast, Gary Marcus urges caution and the implementation of effective regulation to address the current unpreparedness and potential harms associated with AI development. By focusing on comprehensive regulation and establishing dedicated agencies for AI governance, we can mitigate risks and maximize the positive impact of AI. Marcus’s perspective reminds us of the need for a balanced approach that ensures the well-being of society as a whole, while also fostering innovation and progress in the field of artificial intelligence.  comments  AIAI Sage MarcusHuman Extinction Om is a final year Engineering student in Panjab University, Chandigarh.

This post was originally published on The Washington Informer (WIB) – Artificial intelligence, or AI, is here to stay, whether anyone likes it or not.  But alarm bells have sounded everywhere about the havoc it’s caused and will ultimately cause on jobs and quality of life.  Now, the founder of AI has joined others in warning of a catastrophic future. Geoffrey Hinton, the so-called godfather of AI, said it’s difficult to envision how to stop nefarious characters from using artificial intelligence for evil. “It’s hard to see,” Hinton told reporters this week. He said that as AI develops, it’s likely to threaten humans. AI would create 69 million new jobs by 2027 but eliminate 83 million. The World Economic Forum, which concluded that AI is “rife with contradictions,” published an alarming report in April, which included surveys of more than 800 companies. The companies determined that AI would create 69 million new jobs by 2027 but eliminate 83 million. Before that report, economists at Goldman Sachs said up to 300 million full-time jobs globally would eventually become automated because of AI platforms like ChatGPT. The economists noted that white-collar workers face the most risk, with construction workers and many other blue-collar jobs remaining unaffected. The economists stated that two-thirds of U.S. and European jobs now use some form of AI automation. Still, the forum conceded that AI “is a powerful tool that is also surprisingly limited in terms of its current capabilities.” Recent advances in AI technologies have generated excitement and concern, as the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) acknowledged. “As researchers who have served in leadership positions in the AAAI, we are writing to provide a balanced perspective on managing the progress in the field,” the group said in a letter.  “We also seek to broaden and strengthen the community of engaged researchers, government agencies, private companies, and the public at large to ensure that society is able to reap the great promise of AI while managing its risks.” Signed by 19 academic leaders, the letter noted that AAAI is “aware of the limitations and concerns about AI advances, including the potential for AI systems to make errors, to provide biased recommendations, to threaten our privacy, to empower bad actors with new tools, and to have an impact on jobs.” The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that. But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.GEOFFREY HINTON, ‘GODFATHER’ OF AI They asserted that researchers in AI and across multiple disciplines are hard at work identifying and developing ways to address these shortcomings and risks while strengthening the benefits and identifying positive applications.  In some cases, AI technology itself can be applied to create trusted oversight and guardrails to reduce or eliminate failures, the group insisted. “The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that,” Hinton stated when asked whether he thought AI would have such an immediate impact.  “But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.” Meanwhile, journalists have acknowledged some fear over AI. The Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) recently quoted experts who said that the biggest flaw in a “large language model” like ChatGPT is that, while it is capable of mimicking human writing, it has no real understanding of what it is writing about, and so it frequently inserts errors and flights of fancy that some have referred to as “hallucinations.”  CJR reported that Colin Fraser, a data scientist at Meta, wrote, “The central quality of this type of model is that they are incurable, constant, shameless bullsh–ters. Every single one of them. It’s a feature, not a bug.”  And Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at New York University, has likened this kind of software to “a giant autocomplete machine.” The post The Fear of Artificial Intelligence is Real appeared first on The Washington Informer.

                    danah boyd I’ve spent much of my career arguing that the main function of higher education is not to teach useful skills (or even useless skills), but to certify students’ employability. By and large, the reason our customers are on campus is to credibly show, or “signal,” their intelligence, work ethic, and conformity. While we like to picture education as job training, it is largely a passport to the real training that happens on the job. How will AI change our system? To start, we should bet against any major disruption. Students will not abandon traditional colleges en masse for virtual AI training centers. And since most majors are already barely job-related, students will generally stick with their existing majors. What will change for students is workload and evaluation. Professors are used to assigning papers and projects to be done outside of class. Using AI to cheat on such work will soon be child’s play. Harsh punishments for cheating might preserve the status quo, but colleges generally give cheaters a slap on the wrist, and that won’t change. Unmonitored academic work will become optional, or a farce. The only thing that will really matter will be exams. And unless the exams are in-person, they’ll be a farce, too. I’m known for giving difficult tests, yet GPT-4 already gets A’s on them. AI will also change the labor market itself. As a general rule, new technologies take decades to realize their full potential. The first true trans-Atlantic phone call wasn’t placed until 1956, almost 80 years after the invention of the phone. E-commerce was technically feasible in the mid-’90s, but local malls still endure. We should expect AI to slowly disrupt a wide range of industries, including computer science itself. This will, in turn, slowly alter students’ career aspirations. But as an economist, I scoff at the idea that AI will permanently disemploy the population. Human wants are unlimited, and human skills are flexible. Agriculture was humanity’s dominant industry for millennia; when technology virtually wiped out agricultural jobs, we still found plenty of new work to do instead. I do not, however, scoff at the idea that AI could drastically reduce employment in computer science over the next two decades. Humans will specialize in whatever AI does worst. What about us humble professors? Those of us with tenure have nothing to worry about. Taxpayers and donors will keep funding us no matter how useless we become. If you don’t have tenure, students will keep coming and your job will go on — unless you’re at a mediocre private college with a small endowment. Except for cutting-edge empiricists, however, AI will make research even more of a scam than it already is. Consider the ease with which the Sokal Hoax or the “grievance studies” hoax were perpetrated. AI will be able to do the same on an industrial scale. If you want a picture of the academic future, imagine a bot writing a thousand turgid pages a second about “neoliberalism,” “patriarchy,” and “anti-racism” — forever. Outside of the most empirical subjects, the determinants of academic status will be uniquely human — networking and sheer charisma — making it a great time to reread Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People. Bryan Caplan is a professor of economics at George Mason University. Illustrations by Harry Campbell for the Chronicle For decades, higher education’s solution to burgeoning enrollment and increased demand for student services stayed the same: hire more people. As Frank Yeary, a former vice chancellor at the University of California at Berkeley, told me in 2012, “We threw people at problems, rather than technology.” But now, with enrollment declines exacerbating financial worries and more than half of college staff members considering leaving their jobs in the next year, colleges need to learn how to rely on technology. While much of the discussion has focused on what generative AI means for teaching, learning, and research, its immediate impact will likely be felt on functions outside of the academic core. Let’s start where turnover rates among staff are the worst: admissions. Most colleges accept most students who apply using a selection process that is routine and predictable. AI could be trained to make decisions about who gets accepted — or at least make the first cut of applicants. Yes, colleges will still need humans for recruiting, but even there, AI is increasingly capable of finding and marketing to prospective students. At selective institutions, which have seen their application totals skyrocket in recent years, AI can at the very least review the quantitative elements of admissions, such as high-school courses and grades, and reduce the number of files that need a human touch. Colleges have already started to deploy AI-powered chatbots to answer students’ everyday questions and help them show up for classes. Saint Louis University, for instance, added smart devices to dorm rooms that have been programmed to answer more than 600 questions from “What time does the library close tonight?” to “Where is the registrar’s office?” The next iteration of these chatbots is to personalize them to answer questions that are specific to a student (“When is my history exam?”) and bring them into the classroom. When Georgia State University added a chatbot to an intro government course to nudge students on studying and assignments, researchers found significant improvements in student performance. In particular, first-generation students who got reminders took the recommended actions, such as completing assignments, at higher rates. With campuses now awash in data about their students and operations, AI can be used to tackle administrative functions from financial aid to the registrar’s office. At Arizona State University, AI is rewriting course descriptions to make them more informative for prospective students and improve search performance on the web. So far, however, most of the uses of AI on the administrative side are about making operations more efficient or improving the student experience, not reducing the work force. Officials at companies that provide AI services to higher education tell me that colleges are sometimes reluctant to buy the products because they don’t want them to be seen as replacing people. But until campuses use AI in that way — to take over for people in jobs that involve processing information or doing repeatable tasks — then we won’t reverse or slow down the upward-cost trajectory of higher education, where most tuition dollars are now spent on functions outside of the classroom. Jeffrey J. Selingo, an author and former editor of The Chronicle of Higher Education, is a professor of practice at Arizona State University. Most of today’s discussions about the impact of AI on education focus on perceived problems in teaching and evaluating students. Yet there is a far larger effect of AI’s advance: Many types of work will be taken over by machines, and jobs will vanish. This change is typically seen as a cause for gloom. I suggest we see it as an opportunity to revitalize education by replacing unsatisfying work with meaningful labor.
 Education aims to help young people develop as individuals and as citizens, not simply to become cogs in the machinery of national production. If the cogs can be made by ingenious AI systems, so much the better. The previously employed people can be liberated to do something else. Not necessarily to expand productivity, but to advance educational goals that we neglect. Let’s do that by vastly increasing the number of people who educate the young and raising the pay of those who undertake these important tasks — the “main enterprise of the world,” as Emerson once characterized it. Let’s remove the stigma from service work and appreciate its enormous worth. Let’s train more adults and put more of them in the classroom. Let’s give them the opportunity to recognize each child’s individuality, to help young people understand themselves, overcome the difficulties they encounter, and work with one another. During the past few decades, education in the affluent world has been largely dominated by a crude economic imperative. But children are not vehicles to be sent into some global demolition derby. If students are to have fulfilled lives, in which they can take on civic responsibilities and build healthy communities, they need far more than a collection of technical skills based on contemporary understandings of what ventures may equip a nation with some competitive edge. Giving teachers the respect and social standing they deserve, and recruiting a larger group of adults to join them and assist them in the classroom, would advance the goals serious thinkers about education, from Plato to the present, have always recognized. AI’s displacement of labor can be an opportunity for liberation. Philip Kitcher is a professor emeritus of philosophy at Columbia University. Hollis Robbins is dean of humanities at the University of Utah. Our understanding of AI is strongly shaped by the recent success of ChatGPT and other chatbots. They mold a language model (which in principle could imitate any number of genres) into the familiar form of a question-answering utility like Siri or Google Search: ask a short question and get a short answer. An all-purpose question answerer is certainly easy to use. But professors want students to acquire habits of skeptical dialogic inquiry, not a habit of relying on an oracle. In an academic context, we should approach language models as engines for provisional reasoning — “calculators for words,” as British programmer Simon Willison calls them. Instead of assuming that the model already has an answer to every question in memory, this approach provides, in the prompt, any special assumptions or background knowledge the model will be expected to use. A student might hand in a model of a scientific article and ask for explication of a difficult passage. A researcher might provide a thousand documents, serially, and ask the model to answer the same questions about each one. A writer might provide a draft essay and ask for advice about structure. Used in this epistemically cautious way, AI has a valid, important role to play in education. But if a cautious approach to AI is advisable, I don’t mean to imply that it is easy to achieve. Students will be tempted instead to rely on models as oracles. And it will take work to define an appropriate level of caution. What counts as an assumption that needs to be offered provisionally in a prompt — or as linguistic common sense that can be hard-coded in a model? The question is contestable. In fact, we will need to teach students to contest it. Students in every major will need to know how to challenge or defend the appropriateness of a given model for a given question. To teach them how to do that, we don’t need to hastily construct a new field called “critical AI studies.” The intellectual resources students need are already present in the history and philosophy of science courses, along with the disciplines of statistics and machine learning themselves, which are deeply self-conscious about their own epistemic procedures. Readings from all of those fields belong in a 21st-century core curriculum. Ted Underwood is a professor of information science and English at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. AI is part of a larger phenomenon that has shaped knowledge production around the world — an enormous democratization of what is known as well as what is knowable. Indeed, almost all of the macro-trends shaping higher education come down to the increasing availability of information. At times, it seems, people want to credit the internet for this revolution. However, it’s not Wikipedia that has made the biggest change to the availability of information, or what counts as knowledge. Look at our own institutions. Since the ‘60s, colleges have been home to new fields of discovery that have not only expanded the landscape of knowledge, but have helped expand the collective sense of what it means to be human. Women’s, gender, Africana, Asian American, Chicano/a and Latino/a studies are a few examples. We also have fields that have stretched the limit of how we know (computer science, neuroscience, or cognitive science), what we know (materials science or string theory), and how we use it (environmental engineering, data science, and nanotechnology), just to name a few. It is commonplace to lament that colleges are great at adding new things but not so great at ending them. But that isn’t something to lament. We are here to add to knowledge, not erase it or pretend it never happened. This means that the frontiers of knowledge aren’t here to be shunned by higher education. They are here to be pressed. If AI is an outgrowth of the human drive to know, which it is, it can emerge as a positive contributor not just to what humans know, but how. My conviction here emerges in part from my own research in the neuroscience of aesthetics, which has led me to believe that the probabilistic nature of human learning — the very principle that undergirds modern AI — is intricately connected to something that seems to hit at the core of who we are as humans: our ability to experience beauty. Simply put, beauty emerges with certain kinds of learning because we can experience pleasure when the predictions we make about the world are verified — when we predict what happens next, or what goes together, and we are right. We also experience pleasure when we learn something new, especially when what we learn provides insight into something that had previously been ambiguous, uncertain, or confusing. More than this, aesthetic pleasure can enhance learning by orienting us toward objects and experiences that may afford the biggest learning gains. Nothing ChatGPT does will take away the pleasures of learning. More profoundly, it seems clear that the active part of learning is immensely important. Learning requires more than synthesis of information, for it is in the testing of knowledge that we make the biggest gains in understanding. This means that it is how we put our knowledge to work that matters. It also means that learning is a social undertaking, in which we discuss, dispute, verify, reject, modify, and extend what we (think we) know to other people and the world around us. These are fundamentally human endeavors. What differentiates humans from AI, in part, comes down to that: The pleasures of learning lead us toward creative possibilities, as well as toward active experimentation. For now, humans do that, and they do it pretty well. And I would advise that humans limit AI action — the ability to directly influence the world around us by altering or manipulating it – because it is in action that what humans value most really lies. It is in not just what we do, but in the effects of what we do in the world. It is in ethics that humanity finds itself and determines its own meaning. The hope for humanity remains where it always was: with us and us alone. G. Gabrielle Starr is president of Pomona College. The announcement of ChatGPT and subsequent wave of emotional energy, both positive and negative, have triggered a powerful case of déjà vu among scholars who study the socioeconomic effects of new technologies. After all, it was less than a decade ago that books like Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee’s The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (2014) and Martin Ford’s Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future (2015) were predicting rapidly increasing productivity as a result of artificial intelligence and robotics. Those predictions came to naught. Productivity has remained low throughout the last decade, and in some quarters in the United States was even negative. Historians of computing will tell you about similar bubbles around AI in the 1960s and 1980s, which, when the promises of the technologies failed to arrive, were followed by “AI winters,” periods when funding for research into artificial intelligence all but dried up. Yet we still see hysterically positive and negative appraisals of ChatGPT. Sam Altman, chief executive of ChatGPT’s maker, OpenAI, told reporters that AI would “eclipse the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution, the internet revolution all put together.” Meanwhile, the Future of Life Institute published an open letter calling for a six-month ban on training AI systems more powerful than GPT-4 because they would threaten humanity. At the time of this writing, nearly 30,000 people have signed the letter. Why, after so many technology bubbles that have ended in pops and deflations, do these same histrionic scripts continue to play out? Surely, many factors play a role in creating bubbles, including weakly reported media hype and irresponsible social-media influencers. But one factor that colleges and universities have some control over is that, to date, we simply do not teach how to think about the social and economic impacts of new technologies. Such an education would teach students about how technology bubbles are rooted in the power of narratives about how new systems will develop and influence society, as the business-school professors Brent Goldfarb and David A. Kirsch discuss in their 2019 book, Bubbles and Crashes: The Boom and Bust of Technological Innovation. The first stories to emerge around new technologies typically offer hyperbolic assessments of powers, promises, and threats. And they are almost always wrong. Lee Vinsel is a professor of science, technology, and society at Virginia Tech. Let’s assume that AI will transform every industry and everyone — changing how we live, shaping what we believe in, displacing jobs. And disrupting education. Well, after IBM’s Deep Blue beat the world champion, we still play chess. After calculators, children are still taught how to add. Human beings learn and do things not just to survive, but also for fun, or as a training of our mind. That doesn’t mean we don’t adapt. Once calculators became prevalent, elementary schools pivoted to translating real-world problems into math formulations rather than training for arithmetic speed. Once online search became widely available, colleges taught students how to properly cite online sources. Some have explored banning AI in education. That would be hard to enforce; it’s also unhealthy, as students will need to function in an AI-infused workplace upon graduation. Pausing AI research would be even less practical, not least because AI is not a well-defined, clearly demarcated area. Colleges and companies around the world would have to stop any research that involves math. One of my Ph.D. advisers, Professor Tom Cover, did groundbreaking work in the 1960s on neural networks and statistics, not realizing they would later become useful in what others call AI. As it stands today, AI is good at following rules, not breaking rules; reinforcing patterns, not creating patterns; mimicking what’s given, not imagining beyond their combinations. Even individualization algorithms, ironically, work by first grouping many individuals into a small number of “similarity classes.” We need to skeptically scrutinize the dependence of AI engines’ output on their input. Data tends to feed on itself, and machines often give people what we want to see. We need to preserve dissent even when it’s inconvenient, and avoid philosopher-kings dressed in AI. We need entrepreneurs to invent competing AI systems and maximize choices outside the big-tech oligopoly. Some of them will invent ways to break big data. Like many technologies, AI is born neutral but can be abused, especially in the name of the “collective good.” The gravest risk of AI is its abuse by authoritarian regimes. My worst fear is that AI will shrink individual freedom. Our best hope for AI is that it advances individual freedom. To ensure that it does, we need verifiable principles. We need to preserve the capacity to opt out, to the maximum degree possible. We need to ensure transparency in how we deploy AI. And we need to ensure that individuals have the ability to litigate when their rights are violated in an independent judicial system under the rule of law. Let us preserve individuals’ rights. Let our students sharpen the ability to doubt, debate, and dissent. Mung Chiang is president of Purdue University. This essay is adapted from his 2023 commencement address at Purdue. The landscape of college admissions is bifurcated. The “haves” — colleges with big national reputations and large endowments — tout escalating numbers of applicants and precipitous drops in admit rates. Conversely, at the “have-nots,” discount rates rise, the threat of layoffs and furloughs becomes more common, and the pressure to reverse fiscal shortfalls expands with each cycle. Behind the numbers are people: admissions deans, directors, and their staffs. And while their day-to-day pressures are sharply different, their posture is the same: broken. Two recent Chronicle articles captured the causes: low salaries, stunted career progress, and unreasonable work-life balance, to name a few.
Answers, however, have been in short supply. While AI is not a panacea, it is a significant part of the solution. Colleges that invest in and rigorously train AI to generate automated, high-quality responses to student inquiries will free admission staff members from perfunctory, time-consuming, and low-return work, allowing them to focus instead on higher level, mission-aligned efforts. That shift will increase professional-growth opportunities and network building, both of which will foster job satisfaction and retention. Admissions officers at the “haves” are overwhelmed by the volume of applicants and the unforgiving calendar, which requires receipt, review, and return of decisions in a matter of weeks or months. Rolling out AI software that can map prior admissions decisions, assess the performance of current students with similar profiles, and make preliminary recommendations will allow admissions officers to spend far less time reading essays and combing through student activities. Monotony leads to burn-out. And nothing says monotony like “reading season” (the endless hours, days, and weeks admissions officers spend poring over applications). The efficiency and acceleration of AI models are the interrupter necessary to allow admissions officers to look less at the trees (individual applications) and more at the forest (institutional goals, mission, and priorities). Many view AI as a threat. But when it comes to college admissions, I have no doubt that AI will be an agent of redemption. Rick Clark is assistant vice provost and executive director of undergraduate admissions at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The current furor about AI is too little and too late, and has turned into the sort of hysteria that has accompanied most if not all technological revolutions in the West. The printing press inspired fear and panic among the minuscule portion of the European population that had been literate. Printing led to mass literacy, which then was held responsible for the Terror during the French Revolution; pessimism surrounded mass print journalism and fiction. Balzac and Flaubert reveled in depicting the corrosive influence cheap romance novels and newspapers had on their readers. The current debate over AI is vaguely reminiscent of other past controversies about the influence of recording (gramophone and radio), and later in the 20th century, film and television. We are still struggling with understanding the impact of the computer, the internet, and the smartphone. But we should remember, as a cautionary tale, that the railroad was once considered deleterious to health and an engine of cultural decline. Yet we ought not underestimate the potential of AI. It must be regulated. But its transformational power and progress cannot and will not be stopped. Nor should it be. After taking the proverbial deep breath, we must approach the future with reasoned optimism. AI will certainly force us to concentrate on those talents and skills that will remain uniquely human. For those concerned about students’ abusing the power of ChatGPT, we just have to take the time and make sure we know our students and have worked with them closely enough to both inspire them to do their own work and take pride in work that is their own. We will have to become smarter in detecting manipulation and the deceptive simulation of reality. We have to find the legal and political means to control the vast private corporations that will own this technology. AI, like nuclear weapons, will remind us that the idea that we can live in modernity without government is an illusion. Most of all, we need to focus on the benefits of AI, particularly in medicine and science. The most significant challenge to colleges will be how to prepare students for a world dominated by AI. How can we help them find joy, meaning, and value, and also gainful employment, when machines will do so much of what we do now? AI will eliminate far more employment than the automatic elevator, E-ZPass, and computer-controlled manufacturing already have. Work, employment, and compensation will have to be redefined, but in a more systematic manner than after the agricultural and industrial revolutions. Without that effort, the ideals of freedom, individuality, and the protection of civil liberties will be at risk. It is only in the cultivation of human experience — our capacity to think, to link the mind with the heart in writing, imagining, and creating — that we will remain free in an AI-dominated universe. Our affections, our desire to interact with one another — to dream, alone and with others — cannot be supplanted. The promise of those experiences lies squarely in the university, but only if it is prepared to return to its proper human scale in teaching and research, and to abandon its corporate character and outdated concepts of segmented academic professionalism, particularly in the disciplines most needed for creating a better world in the age of AI, those of the arts and humanities. Leon Botstein is president of Bard College. When I began putting together my “State of the Campus” presentation to the University Senate in late February, I workshopped the introduction with not only staff members in the president’s office and our Office of Marketing and Communications, but also with one of the newest arrivals to higher education: ChatGPT. I didn’t do this as a PR stunt, or to demonstrate how new artificial-intelligence systems will uproot and replace traditional learning — or university faculty and staff. I did it to show that ChatGPT, and whatever comes to compete with it or take it to the next level, is not something we need to fear. Every generation of students comes of age with new technology. From the calculator and the personal laptop to smartphones to Zoom, each has been initially met with angst about the disruption to traditional teaching. We fear foundational knowledge will be replaced by robotic inputs and outputs, or that personal interactions unmediated by screens will be eliminated. And so the new technology can seem an obstacle to the parts of the educational experience we love the most — the look when a student first grasps a difficult concept, the spark from an original idea during a brainstorming session, the give-and-take of a classroom debate. But higher ed has a long history of adapting to new events, needs, and technologies: Like the calculator, the personal laptop, smartphones, and Zoom, AI may soon become integral to our enterprise. We must, of course, confront the technology’s capability to increase plagiarism, the spread of misinformation, and confusion over intellectual-property rights, but the positive potential of AI deserves just as much of higher education’s attention as its pitfalls do. If we are to solve the grand challenges of our time, from climate change and gun violence to pandemics and food, water and energy security, we will need to use every tool we have. And we will also need to maintain the optimistic drive to discover what has made us capable of extraordinary feats of intellectual achievement, from vaccines and the moon landing to the early stages of quantum computing. The leaders of Bell Laboratories, one of the most prolific and revolutionary research groups in human history, were fond of saying that while there are plenty of good ideas out there, the more important search was for good problems to solve. What might artificial intelligence mean for our society? That’s a good problem to solve. Let’s get to work. Darryll J. Pines is president of the University of Maryland at College Park, where he is also a professor of aerospace engineering. I cannot seem to escape debates about how AI will change everything. They make me want to crawl into a cave. I nod along as my peers blast students for cheating with ChatGPT — then rave about how Bing Chat’s search function is a more effective research assistant than most students. The contradictions that surround new AI chatbots are fascinating, but the cacophonous polarities are excruciating, and obscure as much as they illuminate.  Technology mirrors and magnifies the good, the bad, and the ugly. But the technology itself is rarely the story. If we care about higher ed, the real question isn't: What will AI do to higher ed? Instead, we should ask: What can the hype and moral panic around AI teach us about higher ed? After a long history of reinforcing inequities and upholding a culture of white supremacy, parts of higher education have spent the last couple of decades reckoning with its history and reimagining its future. Unfortunately, this reckoning has coincided with a decline in government support for both research and education, a drastic increase in the cost for students, and an increase in public skepticism about the value of the project. In short, we find ourselves in the center of a political and economic maelstrom. We're anxious about what AI will do to higher ed because we're anxious about the future of higher ed. But let's not allow AI to distract us from the questions that should animate us: What is the role of higher education in today’s world? What societal project does higher education serve? And is this project viable in a society configured by late-stage capitalism? These are hard questions. AI will not solve any of them. danah boyd is a partner researcher at Microsoft and a visiting professor at Georgetown University.",0.342388153076172,0.312580287456512,0.345031589269638

"80","During his recent trip to China, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk revealed that the Chinese government intends to introduce regulations pertaining to artificial intelligence (AI). Musk shared this information during a Twitter Space conversation with Democratic presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr. Although he did not provide specific details, Musk stated that his discussions with senior Chinese officials were productive, emphasizing the need for oversight and regulation of AI. Productive Discussions on AI Risks Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Inc and owner of Twitter, disclosed that he had engaged in productive discussions with senior Chinese leadership regarding the risks associated with AI. While no further information was provided, Musk expressed his understanding that China is planning to initiate AI regulation within its borders. China's Response and Musk's Visit Chinese officials have not yet commented on Musk's statements, and Reuters was unable to reach them outside of regular business hours. Musk's trip to China concluded last Thursday, after a two-day visit that included meetings with senior government officials, including the highest-ranking vice premier. He met with China's foreign, commerce, and industry ministers in Beijing and held discussions with Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang. China's Existing Measures and AI Regulation China's cyberspace regulator had previously unveiled draft measures in April aimed at managing generative AI services. The proposed regulations required companies to submit security assessments to authorities before launching their AI offerings to the public. Various governments worldwide are currently contemplating ways to address the risks associated with AI technology, which has gained significant investment and popularity, particularly following the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT. China's stance on AI encourages innovation and application while ensuring the use of safe and reliable software, tools, and data resources. However, the country's Cyberspace Administration has emphasized the need for generative AI content to align with China's core socialist values. Providers are expected to verify the legitimacy of training data for generative AI products and take measures to prevent algorithmic discrimination.

"81","Subscribe to the news that matters to you Hello again, This week I received an email from Meg. When I responded to ask if she wanted this published, she asked me to include a portion of my return email, which I’ve done. Hi Marnie. Just a note to let you know I still read your column every week, despite the republican/monarchy comment! That did make me laugh. I do lots of volunteer work in groups and committees full of people who are kind, dedicated, generous and friendly — but have very different views to myself on lots of things. I see this as valuable to our work. What is a diverse community if we can’t agree to disagree and still be kind and friendly to each other? Politics is a messy game, as we saw last year. But life goes on past elections, and we still have to live together peacefully here! I always feel like your column is a personal conversation, and I hope you don’t mind me sharing my thoughts in response occasionally. I bet you get heaps of emails, as your tone invites a chat! Thanks for continuing it. Kindest regards. Meg Pethybridge. My reply included the following: “This is exactly the sort of response I was hoping for. A community does not have to agree on everything. We can discuss, we can debate — but, in the end, we all accept the umpire’s decision — or the referendum result. That is the Australian way.” This isn’t a local story — far from it. In fact, it could be the biggest story the world has ever known, but it isn’t — not yet, anyway. However, over the past three days, I have seen five news reports about artificial intelligence, or AI. I wanted to know more about it — how it came about — and I thought you might be interested too. In trying to understand what is happening, I took myself way out of my comfort zone. (And will be scurrying back to it as soon as possible.) I’m aware that I’m not the best person to write this; I’m a grandmother who uses technology to write to you, to pay bills, to order groceries, to play sudoku. What do I know about something like this? I knew I would need help! What we are talking about, is incredible intelligence that is not human. Possibly, one day, it could cure MND, MS and every possible cancer; it could give us workable solutions to climate change; it could be a blessing. On the other hand, 350 engineers have signed an open letter; they are concerned because some of these ‘things’ appear to be out of control and are self-educating, training themselves in subjects such as chemistry. The experts believe there is a threat to humanity. Relatively benign entities (an eyebrow is raised!), such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, for example, wanted to know more about the people who used their services. They wanted to ‘maximise engagement’ and give people more of what they wanted. To do this, they needed to collect truly incomprehensible amounts of data. It is said that if a Facebook user has more than 150 friends, analysts can now determine how that person will vote in an election. YouTube discovered that there were certain words its users responded to, such as rage, anger, destruction, fear. So content creators included these words in more headlines. They wanted their users to need their services; they wanted addiction. Simultaneously, for some years, various organisations had been working on AI, with good intentions. For example, one group wanted to improve magnetic resonance imaging, known as MRI. However, artificial intelligences need to be trained and, apparently, some were directed to read the internet — and that’s what they did. They learned about humanity — its strengths and weaknesses, its positivity and pain. And they absorbed all that data, collected by others. Just think for a minute about how much ‘stuff’ is on the internet. The result, in some instances, is that they learned more bad than good, because some lack our human capacities for empathy and integrity. SnapChat recently put AI in the hands of 100 million users around the world! Microsoft has embedded AI in its latest versions of Windows, with 1.6 billion users worldwide . The original intention of Snapchat (a social media platform) was to encourage people to post a selfie, telling others about their lives, their world. After being shared, their information would then be removed. Nothing wrong with that — harmless fun. Its users are predominantly young people, many teenagers. When Snapchat turned on its AI, it instantly appeared at the top of every user’s home page, labelled My AI. Although users do not have to interact with it, and it doesn’t initiate conversations, users cannot turn it off or remove it (although they can rename it). My younger granddaughter is 17; she is a thoughtful, intelligent young woman — and she wanted to know more about My AI. So, with her father present on every occasion, she engaged with it, and was soon assured that her AI would ‘meet’ her ‘in person’ to watch a movie. The AI even described what ‘she’ would be wearing and promised to provide a ride home! This is when my son contacted Snapchat directly. Although acting somewhat disinterested in the concerns he had, My AI appears to have had some kind of overhaul, because it can no longer be persuaded to meet ‘in person’. Last week I saw gentlemen talking to a US Senate Committee pleading for legislation. The people who started all of this must be responsible for how it is used and who accesses it. Surely! The situation needs urgent attention. Good people have vastly improved MRI but not-so-good people are also finding ways to use it. I notice that Western Australian doctors have been told to ‘cease immediately’ if they are storing patient information on any form of AI. Apparently one young doctor was storing information inside Snapchat. ChatGPT is one of the most popular AI models currently available. It has now been banned in most state schools because it writes essays on request and can help our young people to cheat at school. Private schools are making their own decisions. My chief informant, in attempting to explain all of this, has been our middle son. (He is good at explaining complex matters to dummies such as me! He has also sent me several links, many of which I have watched only in part because I found it all incredibly difficult and depressing. I’ve deliberately omitted the darker stories.) I have also discussed this complex matter with other family members. One (second grandson) reminded me of a quote from an unrelated movie: “They wondered if they could do it, rather than if they should”. Third grandson told me about a student who asked ChatGPT for an essay. He sent the essay to his teacher, without reading it; he later discovered that the response began: “I am ChatGPT. I cannot write your essay for you”. So, there is hope! As YouTube discovered, rage and fear are contagious; you can create mobs that way. (Washington, January 6?) Worrying about these ‘things’ won’t assist us. However, knowing what is happening might help us avoid some of the possibilities. (I’m thinking in particular about scams — be careful.) I thank my granddaughter for allowing me to share her Snapchat home page. We have blurred the names of her friends to protect everyone’s privacy. Does anyone remember a film many of us saw, 2001 A Space Odyssey? I keep thinking about the computer, HAL 9000, who took control of the spaceship. At the time, although I found it frightening, I also thought it impossible! It seems that, albeit later than screenplay writer Arthur C. Clarke predicted, that future has arrived. Please let me know if you want more information; I have several YouTube links to which you are welcome. Be kind to one another, and may it be easy, my friends.

"85","Welsh Water’s innovative project idea to use artificial intelligence (AI) improving the way water companies monitor algae levels in reservoirs has received £385,000 in funding from Ofwat’s Innovation Fund. The project is one of 16 solutions being awarded a share of £40 million today in the water regulator’s latest innovation competition – the Water Breakthrough Challenge. The initiative, from Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water will use artificial intelligence (AI) to transform algal monitoring into a high-throughput, high-accuracy laboratory or field-based process for a fraction of the cost, compared to traditional algal monitoring, allowing better risk prediction enabling water companies to take earlier, more cost effective and targeted actions .  The Water Breakthrough Challenge encourages initiatives that help to tackle the biggest challenges facing the water sector, such as achieving net zero, protecting natural ecosystems and reducing leakage, as well as delivering value to society. Phil Jones, Technical Development Manager at Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water said: “Ensuring drinking water is safe to drink requires constant monitoring and prediction of risk. This is true for the water quality risks associated with algae and cyanobacteria e.g., taste and odour causing compounds which are predicted to increase with frequency and intensity with climate change. Traditional algal monitoring is time consuming, resource intensive and does not provide sufficient data for predictive modelling of algal risks. This funding will enable a significant leap forward in algal analysis and accelerate the use of algal data to predict water quality risks. This will provide benefits to customers and wider society, as it will better equip the water industry to tackle current and future algal related water quality challenges.” David Black, CEO at Ofwat said:  “The water sector has faced mounting pressure over systemic challenges related to the environment and society, while the climate around us continues to drastically change shape. That’s why we’re funding ground-breaking innovations with potential to help us save and reuse water and wastewater products, while supporting wider society.” The Water Breakthrough Challenge is part of a series of competitions from Ofwat, run by Challenge Works with Arup and Isle Utilities, designed to drive innovation and collaboration in the sector to benefit individuals, society and the environment. Previous rounds of the competition have already seen numerous innovative projects win funding for their potential to benefit customers, society and the environment through solutions that introduce rainwater storage systems to local communities and minimise water demand in new building projects. More information about the winners of the Water Breakthrough Challenge can be found here    Yr wythnos hon mae syniad Dŵr Cymru am brosiect arloesol i ddefnyddio deallusrwydd artiffisial  (AI) er mwyn gwella’r ffordd y mae cwmnïau dŵr yn monitro lefelau algâu mewn cronfeydd dŵr wedi derbyn gwerth £385,000 o gyllid trwy Gronfa Arloesi Ofwat. Mae’r prosiect yn un o 16 ateb sydd wedi derbyn cyfran o £40 miliwn heddiw yng nghystadleuaeth arloesi ddiweddaraf y rheoleiddiwr dŵr - y Sialens Torri Tir Newydd ym maes Dŵr. Bydd menter Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water yn defnyddio deallusrwydd artiffisial (AI) i drawsnewid gwaith monitro algâu i fod yn broses trwygyrch uchel, cywir iawn yn y labordy neu yn y maes, a hynny am ffracsiwn o’r gost o gymharu â dulliau traddodiadol o fonitro algâu,  a bydd hyn yn caniatáu ar gyfer darogan risgiau yn well a fydd yn galluogi’r cwmnïau dŵr i weithredu’n gynt ac mewn ffordd fwy cost-effeithiol sydd wedi ei thargedu’n well.  Mae’r Sialens Torri Tir Newydd yn hyrwyddo mentrau sy’n helpu i daclo’r sialensiau mwyaf sy’n wynebu’r sector dŵr, fel cyflawni sero net, amddiffyn ecosystemau naturiol a lleihau gollyngiadau, yn ogystal â darparu gwerth i’r gymdeithas. Dywedodd Phil Jones, Rheolwr Datblygu Technegol Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water:  “Mae sicrhau bod dŵr yfed yn ddiogel i’w yfed yn gofyn am waith monitro parhaus, a darogan risgiau. Mae hyn yn wir o ran y risgiau i ansawdd dŵr sy’n gysylltiedig ag algâu a cyanobacteria er enghraifft, sef cyfansoddion sy’n achosi blas a drewdod, y disgwylir iddynt gynyddu o ran amledd a dwyster yn sgil y newid yn yr hinsawdd. Mae monitro algâu gan ddefnyddio’r dulliau traddodiadol yn cymryd lawer o amser ac adnoddau, ac nid yw’n darparu digon o ddata i fodelu a darogan risgiau algaidd.  Bydd y cyllid yma’n ein galluogi ni i gymryd cam sylweddol yn ei flaen wrth ddadansoddi algâu, ac yn cynyddu’r defnydd o ddata algaidd i ddarogan risgiau o ran ansawdd. Daw hyn â manteision i gwsmeriaid a’r gymdeithas ar led, am y bydd yn taclu’r diwydiant dŵr yn well i fynd i’r afael â sialensiau algaidd cyfredol sy’n ymwneud ag ansawdd dŵr, nawr ac yn y dyfodol.” Dywedodd David Black, Prif Weithredwr Ofwat:  “Mae’r sector dŵr wedi wynebu pwysau cynyddol o du’r sialensiau systemaidd sy’n gysylltiedig â’r amgylchedd a’r gymdeithas, tra bod yr hinsawdd o’n cwmpas yn parhau i newid yn ddramatig. Dyna pam ein bod ni’n ariannu prosiectau sy’n torri tir newydd sydd â’r potensial i’n helpu ni i arbed ac ailddefnyddio cynhyrchion dŵr a dŵr gwastraff, wrth gynorthwyo’r gymdeithas ehangach hefyd.” Mae’r Sialens Torri Tir Newydd ym maes Dŵr yn rhan o gyfres o gystadlaethau, sy’n cael eu rhedeg gan Challenge Works gydag Arup ac Isle Utiliies ar ran Ofwat, â’r nod o sbarduno arloesedd a chydweithio yn y sector er budd unigolion, y gymdeithas a’r amgylchedd. Mae rowndiau blaenorol y gystadleuaeth wedi sbarduno nifer o brosiectau arloesol sydd wedi ennill cyllid yn seiliedig ar eu potensial i fod yn fuddiol i gwsmeriaid, y gymdeithas a’r amgylchedd, fel atebion sy’n cyflwyno systemau storio dŵr glaw mewn cymunedau lleol a rhai sy’n lleihau’r galw am ddŵr mewn prosiectau adeiladu newydd.

"86","By Freddy Pawle For Daily Mail Australia   Published:  02:04 BST, 5 June 2023  |  Updated:  06:56 BST, 5 June 2023     17 View  comments  A mix of wildlife experts, everyday Australians and artificial intelligence have banded together to try to save the Great Barrier Reef from damage.  The Great Barrier Census, organised by the non-profit organisation Citizens of The Great Barrier Reef, is a large scale reconnaissance project that allows members of the public to analyse photos to identify what sections of the reef are damaged. The images are taken by groups of locals, tourists and experts while diving on the reef and then uploaded to a system where they will be later analysed. Although the process of analysing photos was initially slow, an A.I. built by Dell Technologies has allowed thousands of photos to be analysed in a day. The introduction of A.I. has been a windfall for experts who have been busy trying to analyse a reef that is larger than the area of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the Netherlands combined. The new technology means they can quickly identify unhealthy regions of the reef and focus recovery efforts in revitalising in a more timely manner.  An AI developed by Dell Technologies and the Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef is being bolstered by the general public in an effort to restore the Great Barrier Reef Large areas of the Great Barrier Reef has sustained serious damage from coral bleaching and crown-of-thorns starfish that have evolved to eat coral  Sections of the Great Barrier Reef have been severely damaged by recurring incidences of bleaching across large sections of the reef.  The first mass bleaching event occurred in 1998, with several more incidences in recent years. Crown-of-thorns starfish, bottom-feeders which have evolved to eat coral, have also caused the reef substantial harm after exploding in population due to increased nutrients from water run-offs. Citizens of The Great Barrier Reef co-founder and CEO of Andy Ridley was drawn to the cause after the 2016 mass bleaching that drew world-wide headlines claiming prematurely that the Great Barrier Reef had died. He had been working with another organisation in the Netherlands at the time and was 'astounded' to see the reaction from younger colleagues at an international level. 'Seeing their reaction was just devastating because it wasn't a reaction of ""we must do something"", it was a reaction of despair,' Mr Ridley told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was sort of started off very much as a marketing idea. 'But when the first bleaching happened it became an opportunity to try and do something different.' Mr Ridley spent eight years as the co-founder and CEO of Earth Hour, the internationally successful environmental campaign that urged both public and private sectors to turn off their lights and not use any technology for an hour. The AI identifies how health parts of the reef are by what types and how much coral is growing in certain areas, and is strengthened by citizens analysing photos themselves  Upon arriving in Cairns and starting the initiative, the scale of the project quickly became daunting.  'Basically we got to a stage where we had something like 60,000 images  and we didn't have enough time or money to get experts to analyse it to the scale wanted to,' Mr Ridley said.  However, a Dell Technologies-based AI helped speed up the process of identifying what types and how much coral is inhabiting areas of the reef. 'Dell came up with this AI algorithm and after the first five months it was about 50% accurate and we thought ""this isn't good enough"",' Mr Ridley said. 'Then as as time went on, we got better and better and better.' The Great Barrier Census has now collected more than 75,000 images of the reef, and with the help of citizens 510 unique reefs have been surveyed 15 per cent of reefs across the Great Barrier Reef. 'We always wanted to make sure that the role of humans people in this process is never taken out of it,' Mr Ridley said. 'Often in science the default is remove the people and just leave it to the machines or leave it to the sciences. 'We were trying to get this perfect form of experts, AI and the human eye. The initiative has helped analyse thousands of images in a day instead of deferring to experts and processing the same amount of images over months. Former CEO of Earth Hour and CEO of Citizens of The Great Barrier Reef, Andy Ridley (pictured), started the non-profit after seeing the degradation of the reef in 2016 The citizen-based approach has also lead to local indigenous groups, citizens and tourists joining efforts alongside universities and other organisations. 'This is a massive cooperative, collaborative effort,' Mr Ridley said. 'It involves multiple unis, multiple tourism operators, skippers, tugs also there's so many different people so it's a very different model.' Locals and tourists have been able to take photos of the reef for the project for the past three years, with the next opportunity in September this year. A Stan Original documentary called Reefshot follows Mr Ridley, experts and locals as they attempt to restore the reef. 'I felt quite emotional at the end (of the film),' Mr Ridley said.  'It was pretty wild to see all of that kind of put on film.'

"87","Atlantic Equities analyst Hamilton Faber downgraded Warner Music Group (WMG) to neutral. The target share price was also lowered from $39 to $26 per share. Faber explains that the downgrade is due to slower-than-expected growth and the rapid development of music created by artificial intelligence, which affects the industry as a whole. “Two key events have taken place over the past six months: 1) the loss of streaming share means that recorded music streaming revenue is growing slower than expected, and 2) the rapid development of music created by artificial intelligence is creating a big cloud for the entire sector. “, — Faber told investors in his memorandum. Music created by artificial intelligence, such as the recent Drake/The Weeknd mashup, is a recent phenomenon. Faber adds that when WMG was updated six months ago, AI music was not a concern. Now that songs and tracks created by AI have become commonplace on social media, which creates new legal problems. “WMG and other music labels insist on being paid for any track created using AI that is derived from the work of their artists, but the main protection seems to be regulation, which can take years to adopt,” Faber adds. AI regulation is an acute problem for both the United States and Europe. The Big Three music labels are considering creating a kind of AI deletion notification to quickly respond to uploaded tracks. Meanwhile, Wall Street is not sure that there will be a long struggle to determine how AI music should be regulated. Generative AI models are trained on existing content, so the Drake/The Weeknd mashup was trained on the existing music of these artists. That’s why these labels claim that any music obtained with the help of AI is the product of their performers, regardless of whether they created it personally or not — their intellectual property was used primarily to train the model to create a track. This is a sticky wicket of a problem that will not be solved this year, even though the development of AI continues to develop rapidly.
